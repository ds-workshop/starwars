a new hope,1,THREEPIO,Did you hear that?  They've shut down the main reactor.  We'll be destroyed for sure.  This is madness!
a new hope,2,THREEPIO,We're doomed!
a new hope,3,THREEPIO,There'll be no escape for the Princess this time.
a new hope,4,THREEPIO,What's that?
a new hope,5,THREEPIO,I should have known better than to trust the logic of a half-sized thermocapsulary dehousing assister...
a new hope,6,LUKE,Hurry up!  Come with me!  What are you waiting for?!  Get in gear!
a new hope,7,THREEPIO,"Artoo! Artoo-Detoo, where are you?"
a new hope,8,THREEPIO,At last!  Where have you been?
a new hope,9,THREEPIO,They're heading in this direction. What are we going to do?  We'll be sent to the spice mines of Kessel or smashed into who knows what!
a new hope,10,THREEPIO,"Wait a minute, where are you going?"
a new hope,11,IMPERIAL OFFICER,The Death Star plans are not in the main computer.
a new hope,12,VADER,Where are those transmissions you intercepted?
a new hope,13,REBEL OFFICER,We intercepted no transmissions. Aaah...  This is a consular ship. Were on a diplomatic mission.
a new hope,14,VADER,If this is a consular ship... where is the Ambassador?
a new hope,15,VADER,"Commander, tear this ship apart until you've found those plans and bring me the Ambassador.  I want her alive!"
a new hope,16,TROOPER,There she is! Set for stun!
a new hope,17,TROOPER,She'll be all right. Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner.
a new hope,18,THREEPIO,"Hey, you're not permitted in there.  It's restricted. You'll be deactivated for sure.."
a new hope,19,THREEPIO,"Don't call me a mindless philosopher, you overweight glob of grease!  Now come out before somebody sees you."
a new hope,20,THREEPIO,Secret mission?  What plans?  What are you talking about?  I'm not getting in there!
a new hope,21,THREEPIO,I'm going to regret this.
a new hope,22,CHIEF PILOT,There goes another one.
a new hope,23,CAPTAIN,Hold your fire.  There are no life forms.  It must have been short-circuited.
a new hope,24,THREEPIO,"That's funny, the damage doesn't look as bad from out here."
a new hope,25,THREEPIO,Are you sure this things safe?
a new hope,26,WOMAN,I've told you kids to slow down!
a new hope,27,FIXER,Did I hear a young noise blast through here?
a new hope,28,CAMIE,It was just Wormie on another rampage.
a new hope,29,LUKE,Shape it up you guys!...  Biggs?
a new hope,30,LUKE,I didn't know you were back!  When did you get in?
a new hope,31,BIGGS,"Just now.  I wanted to surprise you, hot shot.  I thought you'd be here... certainly didn't expect you to be out working."
a new hope,32,LUKE,"The Academy didn't change you much... but you're back so soon?  Hey, what happened, didn't you get your commission?"
a new hope,33,BIGGS,Of course I got it.  Signed aboard The Rand Ecliptic last week.  First mate Biggs Darklighter at your service...... I just came back to say goodbye to all you unfortunate landlocked simpletons.
a new hope,34,LUKE,I almost forgot.  There's a battle going on!  Right here in our system.  Come and look!
a new hope,35,DEAK,Not again!  Forget it.
a new hope,36,LUKE,There they are!
a new hope,37,BIGGS,"That's no battle, hot shot... they're just sitting there!  Probably a freighter-tanker refueling."
a new hope,38,LUKE,But there was a lot of firing earlier...
a new hope,39,LUKE,"Hey, easy with those..."
a new hope,40,CAMIE,"Don't worry about it, Wormie."
a new hope,41,FIXER,"I keep telling you, the Rebellion is a long way from here.  I doubt if the Empire would even fight to keep this system.  Believe me Luke, this planet is a big hunk of nothing..."
a new hope,42,LEIA,"Lord Vader, I should have known.  Only you could be so bold.  The Imperial Senate will not sit stillfor this, when they hear you've attacked a diplomatic..."
a new hope,43,VADER,"Don't play games with me, Your Highness.  You weren't on any mercy mission this time.  You passed directly through a restricted system.  Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies.  I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you."
a new hope,44,LEIA,I don't know what you're talking about.  I'm a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan...
a new hope,45,VADER,You're a part of the Rebel Alliance... and a traitor.  Take her away!
a new hope,46,COMMANDER,"Holding her is dangerous.  If word of this gets out, it could generate sympathy for the Rebellion in the senate."
a new hope,47,VADER,I have traced the Rebel spies to her.  Now she is my only link to find their secret base!
a new hope,48,COMMANDER,you anything.
a new hope,49,VADER,Leave that to me.  Send a distress signal and then inform the senate that all aboard were killed!
a new hope,50,SECOND OFFICER,"Lord Vader, the battle station plans are not aboard this ship!  And no transmissions were made.  An escape pod was jettisoned during the fighting, but no life forms were aboard."
a new hope,51,VADER,"She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod.  Send a detachment down to retrieve them.  See to it personally, Commander.  There'll be no one to stop us this time."
a new hope,52,COMMANDER,"Yes, sir."
a new hope,53,THREEPIO,How did I get into this mess?  I really don't know how.  We seem to be made to suffer.  It's our lot in life.
a new hope,54,THREEPIO,I've got to rest before I fall apart.  My joints are almost frozen.
a new hope,55,THREEPIO,What a desolate place this is.
a new hope,56,THREEPIO,Where are you going?
a new hope,57,THREEPIO,"Well, I'm not going that way.  It's much too rocky.  This way is much easier."
a new hope,58,THREEPIO,What makes you think there are settlements over there?
a new hope,59,THREEPIO,Don't get technical with me.
a new hope,60,THREEPIO,"What mission?  What are you talking about?  I've had just about enough of you!  Go that way!  You'll be malfunctioning within a day, you nearsighted scrap pile!"
a new hope,61,THREEPIO,"And don't let me catch you following me begging for help, because you won't get it."
a new hope,62,THREEPIO,No more adventures.  I'm not going that way.
a new hope,63,THREEPIO,"That malfunctioning little twerp.  This is all his fault!  He tricked me into going this way, but he'll do no better."
a new hope,64,THREEPIO,"Wait, what's that?  A transport!  I'm saved!"
a new hope,65,THREEPIO,"Over here!  Help!  Please, help!"
a new hope,66,LUKE,"... so I cut off my power, shut down the afterburners and came in low on Deak's trail.  I was so close I thought I was going to fry my instruments. As it was I busted up the Skyhopper pretty bad.  Uncle Owen was pretty upset.  He grounded me for the rest of the season.  You should have been there... it was fantastic."
a new hope,67,BIGGS,"You ought to take it a little easy Luke.  You may be the hottest bushpilot this side of Mos Eisley, but those little Skyhoppers are dangerous.  Keep it up, and one day, whammo, you're going to be nothing more than a dark spot on the down side of a canyon wall."
a new hope,68,LUKE,Look who's talking.  Now that you've been around those giant starships you're beginning to sound like my uncle. You've gotten soft in the city...
a new hope,69,BIGGS,I've missed you kid.
a new hope,70,LUKE,"Well, things haven't been the same since you left, Biggs.  It's been so...quiet."
a new hope,71,BIGGS,"Luke, I didn't come back just to say goodbye...  I shouldn't tell you this, but you're the only one I can trust... and if I don't come back, I want somebody to know."
a new hope,72,LUKE,What are you talking about?
a new hope,73,BIGGS,"I made some friends at the Academy. ... when our frigate goes to one of the central systems, we're going to jump ship and join the Alliance..."
a new hope,74,LUKE,Join the Rebellion?!  Are you kidding!  How?
a new hope,75,BIGGS,Quiet down will ya!  You got a mouth bigger than a meteor crater!
a new hope,76,LUKE,I'm sorry.  I'm quiet. Listen how quiet I am.  You can barely hear me...
a new hope,77,BIGGS,My friend has a friend on Bestine who might help us make contact.
a new hope,78,LUKE,around forever trying to find them.
a new hope,79,BIGGS,"I know it's a long shot, but if I don't find them I'll do what I can on my own...  It's what we always talked about.  Luke, I'm not going to wait for the Empire to draft me into service.  The Rebellion is spreading and I want to be on the right side - the side I believe in."
a new hope,80,LUKE,And I'm stuck here...
a new hope,81,BIGGS,I thought you were going to the Academy next term.  You'll get your chance to get off this rock.
a new hope,82,LUKE,Not likely!  I had to cancel my application.  There has been a lot of unrest among the Sand People since you left... they've even raided the outskirts of Anchorhead.
a new hope,83,BIGGS,Your uncle could hold off a whole colony of Sand People with one blaster.
a new hope,84,LUKE,"I know, but he's got enough vaporators going to make the place pay off.  He needs me for just one more season.  I can't leave him now."
a new hope,85,BIGGS,"I feel for you, Luke, you're going to have to learn what seems to be important or what really is important.  What good is all your uncle's work if it's taken over by the Empire?...  You know they're starting to nationalize commerce in the central systems...it won't be long before your uncle is merely a tenant, slaving for the greater glory of the Empire."
a new hope,86,LUKE,It couldn't happen here.  You said it yourself.  The Empire won't bother with this rock.
a new hope,87,BIGGS,Things always change.
a new hope,88,LUKE,I wish I was going...  Are you going to be around long?
a new hope,89,BIGGS,"No, I'm leaving in the morning..."
a new hope,90,LUKE,Then I guess I won't see you.
a new hope,91,BIGGS,Maybe someday...  I'll keep a lookout.
a new hope,92,LUKE,"Well, I'll be at the Academy next season... after that who knows.  I won't be drafted into the Imperial Starfleet that's for sure...  Take care of yourself, you'll always be the best friend I've got."
a new hope,93,BIGGS,"So long, Luke."
a new hope,94,THREEPIO,Artoo-Detoo!  It's you!  It's you!
a new hope,95,FIRST TROOPER,Someone was in the pod.  The tracks go off in this direction.
a new hope,96,SECOND TROOPER,"Look, sir - droids."
a new hope,97,THREEPIO,Wake up!  Wake up!
a new hope,98,THREEPIO,We're doomed.
a new hope,99,THREEPIO,Do you think they'll melt us down?
a new hope,100,THREEPIO,Don't shoot!  Don't shoot!  Will this never end?
a new hope,101,BERU,"Luke, tell Owen that if he gets a translator to be sure it speaks Bocce."
a new hope,102,LUKE,It looks like we don't have much of a choice but I'll remind him.
a new hope,103,OWEN,I have no need for a protocol droid.
a new hope,104,THREEPIO,Sir - not in an environment such as this - that's why I've also been programmed for over thirty secondary functions that...
a new hope,105,OWEN,What I really need is a droid that understands the binary languages of moisture vaporators.
a new hope,106,THREEPIO,Vaporators!  Sir - My first job was programming binary load lifters... very similar to your vaporators.  You could say...
a new hope,107,OWEN,Do you speak Bocce?
a new hope,108,THREEPIO,"Of course I can, sir.  It's like a second language for me...  I'm as fluent in Bocce..."
a new hope,109,OWEN,All right; shut up! I'll take this one.
a new hope,110,THREEPIO,"Shutting up, sir."
a new hope,111,OWEN,"Luke, take these two over to the garage, will you?  I want you to have both of them cleaned up before dinner."
a new hope,112,LUKE,But I was going into Toshi Station to pick up some power converters...
a new hope,113,OWEN,"You can waste time with your friends when your chores are done.  Now, come on, get to it!"
a new hope,114,LUKE,"All right, come on!  And the red one, come on.  Well, come on, Red, let's go."
a new hope,115,LUKE,Uncle Owen...
a new hope,116,OWEN,Yeah?
a new hope,117,LUKE,This R2 unit has a bad motivator.  Look!
a new hope,118,OWEN,"Hey, what're you trying to push on us?"
a new hope,119,THREEPIO,"Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit is in prime condition.  A real bargain."
a new hope,120,LUKE,Uncle Owen...
a new hope,121,OWEN,Yeah?
a new hope,122,LUKE,What about that one?
a new hope,123,OWEN,What about that blue one?  We'll take that one.
a new hope,124,LUKE,"Yeah, take it away."
a new hope,125,THREEPIO,"Uh, I'm quite sure you'll be very pleased with that one, sir.  He really is in first-class condition.  I've worked with him before.  Here he comes."
a new hope,126,LUKE,"Okay, let's go."
a new hope,127,THREEPIO,"Now, don't forget this!  Why I should stick my neck out for you is quite beyond my capacity!"
a new hope,128,THREEPIO,"Thank the maker!  This oil bath is going to feel so good.  I've got such a bad case of dust contamination, I can barely move!"
a new hope,129,LUKE,"It just isn't fair.  Oh, Biggs is right.  I'm never gonna get out of here!"
a new hope,130,THREEPIO,Is there anything I might do to help?
a new hope,131,LUKE,"Well, not unless you can alter time, speed up the harvest, or teleport me off this rock!"
a new hope,132,THREEPIO,"I don't think so, sir.  I'm only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things.  Not on this planet, anyways.  As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which planet I'm on."
a new hope,133,LUKE,"Well, if there's a bright center to the universe, you're on the planet that it's farthest from."
a new hope,134,THREEPIO,"I see, sir."
a new hope,135,LUKE,"Uh, you can call me Luke."
a new hope,136,THREEPIO,"I see, sir Luke."
a new hope,137,LUKE,Just Luke.
a new hope,138,THREEPIO,"And I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, Artoo-Detoo."
a new hope,139,LUKE,Hello.
a new hope,140,LUKE,You got a lot of carbon scoring here.  It looks like you boys have seen a lot of action.
a new hope,141,THREEPIO,"With all we've been through, sometimes I'm amazed we're in as good condition as we are, what with the Rebellion and all."
a new hope,142,LUKE,You know of the Rebellion against the Empire?
a new hope,143,THREEPIO,"That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning, sir."
a new hope,144,LUKE,Have you been in many battles?
a new hope,145,THREEPIO,"Several, I think.  Actually, there's not much to tell.  I'm not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling stories.  Well, not at making them interesting, anyways."
a new hope,146,LUKE,"Well, my little friend, you've got something jammed in here real good.  Were you on a starcruiser or..."
a new hope,147,LEIA,"Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.  You'remy only hope."
a new hope,148,LUKE,What's this?
a new hope,149,THREEPIO,What is what?!?  He asked you a question...What is that?
a new hope,150,LEIA,"Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.  You're my only hope.  Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.  You're my only hope."
a new hope,151,THREEPIO,"Oh, he says it's nothing, sir.  Merely a malfunction.  Old data.  Pay it no mind."
a new hope,152,LUKE,Who is she?  She's beautiful.
a new hope,153,THREEPIO,"I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir."
a new hope,154,LEIA,"Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi..."
a new hope,155,THREEPIO,"I think she was a passenger on our last voyage.  A person of some importance, sir - I believe.  Our captain was attached to..."
a new hope,156,LUKE,Is there more to this recording?
a new hope,157,THREEPIO,"Behave yourself, Artoo.  You're going to get us in trouble.  It's all right, you can trust him.  He's our new master."
a new hope,158,THREEPIO,"He says he's the property of Obi-Wan Kenobi, a resident of these parts.  And it's a private message for him.  Quite frankly, sir, I don't know what he's talking about.  Our last master was Captain Antilles, but with what we've been through, this little R2 unit has become a bit eccentric."
a new hope,159,LUKE,Obi-Wan Kenobi?  I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi?
a new hope,160,THREEPIO,"I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know what he's talking about?"
a new hope,161,LUKE,"Well, I don't know anyone named Obi-Wan, but old Ben lives out beyond the dune sea.  He's kind of a strange old hermit."
a new hope,162,LUKE,I wonder who she is.  It sounds like she's in trouble.  I'd better play back the whole thing.
a new hope,163,THREEPIO,"He says the restraining bolt has short circuited his recording system.  He suggests that if you remove the bolt, he might be able to play back the entire recording."
a new hope,164,LUKE,"H'm?  Oh, yeah, well, I guess you're too small to run away on me if I take this off!  Okay."
a new hope,165,LUKE,There you go.
a new hope,166,LUKE,"Well, wait a minute.  Where'd she go?  Bring her back!  Play back the entire message."
a new hope,167,THREEPIO,been playing.  The one you're carrying inside your rusty innards!
a new hope,168,AUNT BERU,Luke?  Luke!  Come to dinner!
a new hope,169,LUKE,"All right, I'll be right there, Aunt Beru."
a new hope,170,THREEPIO,"I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to have picked up a slight flutter."
a new hope,171,LUKE,"Well, see what you can do with him.  I'll be right back."
a new hope,172,THREEPIO,Just you reconsider playing that message for him.
a new hope,173,THREEPIO,"No, I don't think he likes you at all."
a new hope,174,THREEPIO,"No, I don't like you either."
a new hope,175,LUKE,"You know, I think that R2 unit we bought might have been stolen."
a new hope,176,OWEN,What makes you think that?
a new hope,177,LUKE,"Well, I stumbled across a recording while I was cleaning him.  He says he belongs to someone called Obi-Wan Kenobi."
a new hope,178,LUKE,"I thought he might have meant Ben.  Do you know what he's talking about?  Well, I wonder if he's related to Ben."
a new hope,179,OWEN,That old man's just a crazy wizard.  Tomorrow I want you to take that R2 unit into Anchorhead and have its memory flushed.  That'll be the end of it.  It belongs to us now.
a new hope,180,LUKE,But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking for him?
a new hope,181,OWEN,"He won't, I don't think he exists any more.  He died about the same time as your father."
a new hope,182,LUKE,He knew my father?
a new hope,183,OWEN,I told you to forget it.  Your only concern is to prepare the new droids for tomorrow.  In the morning I want them on the south ridge working out those condensers.
a new hope,184,LUKE,"Yes, sir.  I think those new droids are going to work out fine.  In fact, I, uh, was also thinking about our agreement about my staying on another season.  And if these new droids do work out, I want to transmit my application to the Academy this year."
a new hope,185,OWEN,You mean the next semester before harvest?
a new hope,186,LUKE,"Sure, there're more than enough droids."
a new hope,187,OWEN,Harvest is when I need you the most.  Only one more season.  This year we'll make enough on the harvest so I'll be able to hire some more hands.  And then you can go to the Academy next year.
a new hope,188,OWEN,"You must understand I need you here, Luke."
a new hope,189,LUKE,But it's a whole 'nother year.
a new hope,190,OWEN,"Look, it's only one more season."
a new hope,191,LUKE,"Yeah, that's what you said last year when Biggs and Tank left."
a new hope,192,AUNT BERU,Where are you going?
a new hope,193,LUKE,It looks like I'm going nowhere.  I have to finish cleaning those droids.
a new hope,194,AUNT BERU,"Owen, he can't stay here forever.  Most of his friends have gone.  It means so much to him."
a new hope,195,OWEN,I'll make it up to him next year.  I promise.
a new hope,196,AUNT BERU,"Luke's just not a farmer, Owen.  He has too much of his father in him."
a new hope,197,OWEN,That's what I'm afraid of.
a new hope,198,LUKE,What are you doing hiding there?
a new hope,199,THREEPIO,"It wasn't my fault, sir.  Please don't deactivate me.  I told him not to go, but he's faulty, malfunctioning; kept babbling on about his mission."
a new hope,200,LUKE,"Oh, no!"
a new hope,201,THREEPIO,That R2 unit has always been a problem.  These astro-droids are getting quite out of hand.  Even I can't understand their logic at times.
a new hope,202,LUKE,How could I be so stupid?  He's nowhere in sight.  Blast it!
a new hope,203,THREEPIO,"Pardon me, sir, but couldn't we go after him?"
a new hope,204,LUKE,It's too dangerous with all the Sand People around.  We'll have to wait until morning.
a new hope,205,OWEN,"Luke, I'm shutting the power down for the night."
a new hope,206,LUKE,"All right, I'll be there in a few minutes.  Boy, am I gonna get it."
a new hope,207,LUKE,You know that little droid is going to cause me a lot of trouble.
a new hope,208,THREEPIO,"Oh, he excels at that, sir."
a new hope,209,OWEN,Luke?  Luke?  Luke?  Where could he be loafing now!
a new hope,210,OWEN,Have you seen Luke this morning?
a new hope,211,AUNT BERU,"He said he had some things to do before he started today, so he left early."
a new hope,212,OWEN,Uh?  Did he take those two new droids with him?
a new hope,213,AUNT BERU,I think so.
a new hope,214,OWEN,"Well, he'd better have those units in the south range repaired bemidday or there'll be hell to pay!"
a new hope,215,LUKE,How's that.
a new hope,216,LUKE,"Old Ben Kenobi lives out in this direction somewhere, but I don't see how that R2 unit could have come this far.  We must have missed him.  Uncle Owen isn't going to take this very well."
a new hope,217,THREEPIO,"Sir, would it help if you told him it was my fault."
a new hope,218,LUKE,Sure.  He needs you.  He'd probably only deactivate you for a day or so...
a new hope,219,THREEPIO,"Deactivate!  Well, on the other hand if you hadn't removed his restraining bolt..."
a new hope,220,LUKE,"Wait, there's something dead ahead on the scanner.  It looks like our droid... hit the accelerator."
a new hope,221,LUKE,"Hey, whoa, just where do you think you're going?"
a new hope,222,THREEPIO,"Master Luke here is your rightful owner.  We'll have no more of this Obi-Wan Kenobi jibberish... and don't talk to me of your mission, either.  You're fortunate he doesn't blast you into a million pieces right here."
a new hope,223,LUKE,"Well, come on. It's getting late.  I only hope we can get back before Uncle Owen really blows up."
a new hope,224,THREEPIO,"If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I think you should deactivate the little fugitive until you've gotten him back to your workshop."
a new hope,225,LUKE,"No, he's not going to try anything."
a new hope,226,LUKE,What's wrong with him now?
a new hope,227,THREEPIO,"Oh my... sir, he says there are several creatures approaching from the southeast."
a new hope,228,LUKE,"Sand People!  Or worse!  Come on, let's have a look.  Come on."
a new hope,229,LUKE,"There are two Banthas down there but I don't see any... wait a second, they're Sand People all right.  I can see one of them now."
a new hope,230,BEN,Hello there!  Come here my little friend.  Don't be afraid.
a new hope,231,BEN,"Don't worry, he'll be all right."
a new hope,232,LUKE,What happened?
a new hope,233,BEN,"Rest easy, son, you've had a busy day.  You're fortunate you're still in one piece."
a new hope,234,LUKE,"Ben?  Ben Kenobi!  Boy, am I glad to see you!"
a new hope,235,BEN,"The Jundland Wastes are not to be traveled lightly.  Tell me, young Luke, what brings you out this far?"
a new hope,236,LUKE,"Oh, this little droid!  I think he's searching for his former master...  I've never seen such devotion in a droid before... there seems tobe no stopping him.  He claims to be the property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi.  Is he a relative of yours?  Do you know who he's talking about?"
a new hope,237,BEN,Obi-Wan Kenobi... Obi-Wan?  Now thats a name I haven't heard in a long time... a long time.
a new hope,238,LUKE,I think my uncle knew him.  He said he was dead.
a new hope,239,BEN,"Oh, he's not dead, no... not yet."
a new hope,240,LUKE,You know him!
a new hope,241,BEN,"Well of course, of course I know him.  He's me!  I haven't gone by the name Obi-Wan since oh, before you were born."
a new hope,242,LUKE,Then the droid does belong to you.
a new hope,243,BEN,Don't seem to remember ever owning a droid.  Very interesting...
a new hope,244,BEN,I think we better get indoors.  The Sand People are easily startled but they will soon be back and in greater numbers.
a new hope,245,LUKE,... Threepio!
a new hope,246,THREEPIO,Where am I?  I must have taken a bad step...
a new hope,247,LUKE,Can you stand?  We've got to get out of here before the Sand People return.
a new hope,248,THREEPIO,"I don't think I can make it.  You go on, Master Luke.  There's no sense in you risking yourself on my account.  I'm done for."
a new hope,249,LUKE,"No, you're not.  What kind of talk is that?"
a new hope,250,BEN,"Quickly, son... they're on the move."
a new hope,251,LUKE,"No, my father didn't fight in the wars.  He was a navigator on a spice freighter."
a new hope,252,BEN,That's what your uncle told you.  He didn't hold with your father's ideals.  Thought he should have stayed here and not gotten involved.
a new hope,253,LUKE,You fought in the Clone Wars?
a new hope,254,BEN,"Yes, I was once a Jedi Knight the same as your father."
a new hope,255,LUKE,I wish I'd known him.
a new hope,256,BEN,"He was the best star-pilot in the galaxy, and a cunning warrior.  I understand you've become quite a good pilot yourself.  And he was a good friend.  Which reminds me..."
a new hope,257,BEN,"I have something here for you.  Your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough, but your uncle wouldn't allow it.  He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan on some damned-fool idealistic crusade like your father did."
a new hope,258,THREEPIO,"Sir, if you'll not be needing me, I'll close down for awhile."
a new hope,259,LUKE,"Sure, go ahead."
a new hope,260,LUKE,What is it?
a new hope,261,BEN,Your fathers lightsaber.  This is the weapon of a Jedi Knight.  Not as clumsy or as random as a blaster.
a new hope,262,BEN,"An elegant weapon for a morecivilized time.  For over a thousand generations the Jedi Knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the Old Republic.  Before the dark times, before the Empire."
a new hope,263,LUKE,How did my father die?
a new hope,264,BEN,"A young Jedi named Darth Vader, who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil, helped the Empire hunt down and destroy the Jedi Knights.  He betrayed and murdered your father.  Now the Jedi are all but extinct.  Vader was seduced by the dark side of the Force."
a new hope,265,LUKE,The Force?
a new hope,266,BEN,"Well, the Force is what gives the Jedi his power.  It's an energy field created by all living things.  It surrounds us and penetrates us.  It binds the galaxy together."
a new hope,267,BEN,"Now, let's see if we can't figure out what you are, my little friend.  And where you come from."
a new hope,268,LUKE,I saw part of the message he was...
a new hope,269,BEN,I seem to have found it.
a new hope,270,LEIA,"General Kenobi, years ago you served my father in the Clone Wars.  Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire.  I regret that I am unable to present my father's request to you in person, but my ship has fallen under attack and I'm afraid my mission to bring you to Alderaan has failed.  I have placed information vital to the survival of the Rebellion into the memory systems of this R2 unit.  My father will know how to retrieve it.  You must see this droid safely delivered to him on Alderaan.  This is our most desperate hour.  Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope."
a new hope,271,BEN,You must learn the ways of the Force if you're to come with me to Alderaan.
a new hope,272,LUKE,"Alderaan?  I'm not going to Alderaan.  I've got to go home.  It's late, I'm in for it as it is."
a new hope,273,BEN,"I need your help, Luke.  I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.She needs your help."
a new hope,274,LUKE,I can't get involved!  I've got work to do!  It's not that I like the Empire.  I hate it!  But there's nothing I can do about it right now.  It's such a long way from here.
a new hope,275,BEN,That's your uncle talking.
a new hope,276,LUKE,"Oh, God, my uncle.  How am I ever going to explain this?"
a new hope,277,BEN,"Learn about the Force, Luke."
a new hope,278,LUKE,"Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead.  You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going."
a new hope,279,BEN,"You must do what you feel is right, of course."
a new hope,280,TAGGE,Until this battle station is fully operational we are vulnerable.  The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped.  They're more dangerous than you realize.
a new hope,281,MOTTI,"Dangerous to your starfleet, Commander; not to this battle station!"
a new hope,282,TAGGE,The Rebellion will continue to gain support in the Imperial Senate as long as....
a new hope,283,TARKIN,The Imperial Senate will no longer be of any concern to us.  I've just received word that the Emperor has dissolved the council permanently.  The last remnants of the Old Republic have been swept away.
a new hope,284,TAGGE,That's impossible!  How will the Emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy?
a new hope,285,TARKIN,The regional governors now have direct control over territories.  Fear will keep the local systems in line.  Fear of this battle station.
a new hope,286,TAGGE,"And what of the Rebellion?  If the Rebels have obtained a complete technical readout of this station, it is possible, however unlikely, that they might find a weakness and exploit it."
a new hope,287,VADER,The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.
a new hope,288,MOTTI,"Any attack made by the Rebels against this station would be a useless gesture, no matter what technical data they've obtained.  This station is now the ultimate power in the universe.  I suggest we use it!"
a new hope,289,VADER,Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed.  The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.
a new hope,290,MOTTI,"Don't try to frighten us with your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader.  Your sad devotion to that ancient religion has not helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes, or given you clairvoyance enough to find the Rebel's hidden fort..."
a new hope,291,VADER,I find your lack of faith disturbing.
a new hope,292,TARKIN,"Enough of this!  Vader, release him!"
a new hope,293,VADER,As you wish.
a new hope,294,TARKIN,This bickering is pointless.  Lord Vader will provide us with the location of the Rebel fortress by the time this station is operational.  We will then crush the Rebellion with one swift stroke.
a new hope,295,LUKE,"It looks like Sand People did this, all right.  Look, here are gaffi sticks, bantha tracks.  It's just... I never heard of them hitting anything this big before."
a new hope,296,BEN,They didn't.  But we are meant to think they did.  These tracks are side by side.  Sand People always ride single file to hide there numbers.
a new hope,297,LUKE,These are the same Jawas that sold us Artoo and Threepio.
a new hope,298,BEN,"And these blast points, too accurate for Sand People.  Only Imperial stormtroopers are so precise."
a new hope,299,LUKE,Why would Imperial troops want to slaughter Jawas?
a new hope,300,LUKE,"If they traced the robots here, they may have learned who they sold them to.  And that would lead them back home!"
a new hope,301,BEN,"Wait, Luke!  It's too dangerous."
a new hope,302,LUKE,Uncle Owen!  Aunt Beru!  Uncle Owen!
a new hope,303,VADER,"And, now Your Highness, we will discuss the location of your hidden Rebel base."
a new hope,304,BEN,"There's nothing you could have done, Luke, had you been there.  You'd have been killed, too, and the droids would now be in the hands of the Empire."
a new hope,305,LUKE,I want to come with you to Alderaan.  There's nothing here for me now.  I want to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi like my father.
a new hope,306,BEN,Mos Eisley Spaceport.  You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy.  We must be cautious.
a new hope,307,TROOPER,How long have you had these droids?
a new hope,308,LUKE,About three or four seasons.
a new hope,309,BEN,They're for sale if you want them.
a new hope,310,TROOPER,Let me see your identification.
a new hope,311,BEN,You don't need to see his identification.
a new hope,312,TROOPER,We don't need to see his identification.
a new hope,313,BEN,looking for.
a new hope,314,TROOPER,These are not the droids we're looking for.
a new hope,315,BEN,He can go about his business.
a new hope,316,TROOPER,You can go about your business.
a new hope,317,BEN,Move along.
a new hope,318,TROOPER,Move along.  Move along.
a new hope,319,THREEPIO,I can't abide these Jawas.  Disgusting creatures.
a new hope,320,LUKE,"Go on, go on.  I can't understand how we got by those troopers.  I thought we were dead."
a new hope,321,BEN,The Force can have a strong influence on the weak-minded.  You will find it a powerful ally.
a new hope,322,LUKE,Do you really think we're going to find a pilot here that'll take us to Alderaan?
a new hope,323,BEN,"Well, most of the best freighter pilots can be found here.  Only watch your step.  This place can be a little rough."
a new hope,324,LUKE,I'm ready for anything.
a new hope,325,THREEPIO,"Come along, Artoo."
a new hope,326,BARTENDER,We don't serve their kind here!
a new hope,327,LUKE,What?
a new hope,328,BARTENDER,Your droids. They'll have to wait outside.  We don't want them here.
a new hope,329,LUKE,"Listen, why don't you wait out by the speeder.  We don't want any trouble."
a new hope,330,THREEPIO,I heartily agree with you sir.
a new hope,331,CREATURE,Negola dewaghi wooldugger?!?
a new hope,332,HUMAN,He doesn't like you.
a new hope,333,LUKE,I'm sorry.
a new hope,334,HUMAN,I don't like you either
a new hope,335,HUMAN,Don't insult us.  You just watch yourself.  We're wanted men.  I have the death sentence on twelve systems.
a new hope,336,LUKE,I'll be careful than.
a new hope,337,HUMAN,You'll be dead.
a new hope,338,BEN,This little one isn't worth the effort.  Come let me buy you something...
a new hope,339,BARTENDER,No blasters!  No blaster!
a new hope,340,BEN,This is Chewbacca.  He's first-mate on a ship that might suit our needs.
a new hope,341,THREEPIO,I don't like the look of this.
a new hope,342,HAN,Han Solo.  I'm captain of the Millennium Falcon.  Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the Alderaan system.
a new hope,343,BEN,"Yes, indeed.  If it's a fast ship."
a new hope,344,HAN,Fast ship?  You've never heard of the Millennium Falcon?
a new hope,345,BEN,Should I have?
a new hope,346,HAN,It's the ship that made the Kessel run in less than twelve parsecs!
a new hope,347,HAN,"I've outrun Imperial starships, not the local bulk-cruisers, mind you.  I'm talking about the big Corellian ships now.  She's fast enough for you, old man.  What's the cargo?"
a new hope,348,BEN,"Only passengers.  Myself, the boy, two droids, and no questions asked."
a new hope,349,HAN,What is it?  Some kind of local trouble?
a new hope,350,BEN,Let's just say we'd like to avoid any Imperial entanglements.
a new hope,351,HAN,"Well, that's the real trick, isn't it?  And it's going to cost you something extra.  Ten thousand in advance."
a new hope,352,LUKE,Ten thousand?  We could almost buy our own ship for that!
a new hope,353,HAN,"But who's going to fly it, kid!  You?"
a new hope,354,LUKE,You bet I could.  I'm not such a bad pilot myself!  We don't have to sit here and listen...
a new hope,355,BEN,"We haven't that much with us.  But we could pay you two thousand now, plus fifteen when we reach Alderaan."
a new hope,356,HAN,"Seventeen, huh!"
a new hope,357,HAN,Okay.  You guys got yourself a ship.  We'll leave as soon as you're ready.  Docking bay Ninety-four.
a new hope,358,BEN,Ninety-four.
a new hope,359,HAN,Looks like somebody's beginning to take an interest in your handiwork.
a new hope,360,TROOPER,"All right, we'll check it out."
a new hope,361,HAN,Seventeen thousand!  Those guys must really be desperate.  This could really save my neck.  Get back to the ship and get her ready.
a new hope,362,BEN,You'll have to sell your speeder.
a new hope,363,LUKE,That's okay.  I'm never coming back to this planet again.
a new hope,364,GREEDO,"Going somewhere, Solo?"
a new hope,365,HAN,"Yes, Greedo.  As a matter of fact, I was just going to see your boss.  Tell Jabba that I've got his money."
a new hope,366,GREEDO,"It's too late.  You should have paid him when you had the chance.  Jabba's put a price on your head, so large that every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you.  I'm lucky I found you first."
a new hope,367,HAN,"Yeah, but this time I got the money."
a new hope,368,GREEDO,"If you give it to me, I might forget I found you."
a new hope,369,HAN,I don't have it with me.  Tell Jabba...
a new hope,370,GREEDO,Jabba's through with you.  He has no time for smugglers who drop their shipments at the first sign of an Imperial cruiser.
a new hope,371,HAN,Even I get boarded sometimes.  Do you think I had a choice?
a new hope,372,GREEDO,You can tell that to Jabba.  He may only take your ship.
a new hope,373,HAN,Over my dead body.
a new hope,374,GREEDO,That's the idea I've been looking forward to killing you for a long time.
a new hope,375,HAN,"Yes, I'll bet you have."
a new hope,376,HAN,Sorry about the mess.
a new hope,377,VADER,Her resistance to the mind probe is considerable.  It will be some time before we can extract any information from her.
a new hope,378,IMPERIAL OFFICER,The final check-out is complete.  All systems are operational.  What course shall we set?
a new hope,379,TARKIN,Perhaps she would respond to an alternative form of persuasion.
a new hope,380,VADER,What do you mean?
a new hope,381,TARKIN,I think it is time we demonstrate the full power of this station.Set your course for Princess Leia's home planet of Alderaan.
a new hope,382,TROOPER,With pleasure.
a new hope,383,THREEPIO,"Lock the door, Artoo."
a new hope,384,TROOPER,"All right, check that side of the street.  It's secure.  Move on to the next door."
a new hope,385,THREEPIO,"I would much rather have gone with Master Luke than stay here with you.  I don't know what all this trouble is about, but I'm sure it must be your fault."
a new hope,386,THREEPIO,You watch your language!
a new hope,387,LUKE,"He says it's the best he can do.  Since the XP-38 came out, they"
a new hope,388,BEN,It will be enough.
a new hope,389,BEN,"If the ship's as fast as he's boasting, we ought to do well."
a new hope,390,JABBA,"Come on out, Solo!"
a new hope,391,HAN,"I've been waiting for you, Jabba."
a new hope,392,JABBA,I expected you would be.
a new hope,393,HAN,I'm not the type to run.
a new hope,394,JABBA,"Han, my boy, there are times when you disappoint me... why haven't you paid me?  And why did you have to fry poor Greedo like that... after all we've been through together."
a new hope,395,HAN,You sent Greedo to blast me.
a new hope,396,JABBA,"Han, why you're the best smuggler in the business.  You're too valuable to fry.  He was only relaying my concern at your delays.  He wasn't going to blast you."
a new hope,397,HAN,"I think he thought he was.  Next time don't send one of those twerps.  If you've got something to say to me, come see me yourself."
a new hope,398,JABBA,"Han, Han!  If only you hadn't had to dump that shipment of spice... you understand I just can't make an exception.  Where would I be if every pilot who smuggled for me dumped their shipment at the first sign of an Imperial starship?  It's not good business."
a new hope,399,HAN,"You know, even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.  I had no choice, but I've gota charter now and I can pay you back, plus a little extra.  I just need some more time."
a new hope,400,JABBA,"Put your blasters away.  Han, my boy, I'm only doing this because you're the best and I need you.  So, for an extra, say... twenty percent I'll give you a little more time... but this is it.  If you disappoint me again, I'll put a price on your head so large you won't be able to go near a civilized system for the rest of your short life."
a new hope,401,HAN,"Jabba, I'll pay you because it's my pleasure."
a new hope,402,LUKE,What a piece of junk.
a new hope,403,HAN,"She'll make point five beyond the speed of light.  She may not look like much, but she's got it where it counts, kid.  I've added some special modifications myself."
a new hope,404,HAN,"We're a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of here."
a new hope,405,THREEPIO,"Hello, sir."
a new hope,406,TROOPER,Which way?
a new hope,407,TROOPER,"All right, men.  Load your weapons!"
a new hope,408,TROOPER,Stop that ship!
a new hope,409,TROOPER,Blast 'em!
a new hope,410,HAN,"Chewie, get us out of here!"
a new hope,411,THREEPIO,"Oh, my.  I'd forgotten how much I hate space travel."
a new hope,412,HAN,It looks like an Imperial cruiser.  Our passengers must be hotter than I thought.  Try and hold them off.  Angle the deflector shield while I make the calculations for the jump to light speed.
a new hope,413,HAN,Stay sharp!  There are two more coming in; they're going to try to cut us off.
a new hope,414,LUKE,Why don't you outrun them?  I thought you said this thing was fast.
a new hope,415,HAN,"Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to find yourself floating home.  We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace.  Besides, I know a few maneuvers. We'll lose them!"
a new hope,416,HAN,Here's where the fun begins!
a new hope,417,BEN,How long before you can make the jump to light speed?
a new hope,418,HAN,It'll take a few moments to get the coordinates from the navi-computer.
a new hope,419,LUKE,Are you kidding?  At the rate they're gaining...
a new hope,420,HAN,"Traveling through hyperspace isn't like dusting crops, boy!  Without precise calculations we could fly right through a star or bounce too close to a supernova and that'd end your trip real quick, wouldn't it?"
a new hope,421,LUKE,What's that flashing?
a new hope,422,HAN,"We're losing our deflector shield.  Go strap yourself in, I'm going to make the jump to light speed."
a new hope,423,MOTTI,We've entered the Alderaan system.
a new hope,424,LEIA,"Governor Tarkin, I should have expected to find you holding Vader's leash.  I recognized your foul stench when I was brought on board."
a new hope,425,TARKIN,Charming to the last.  You don't know how hard I found it signing the order to terminate your life!
a new hope,426,LEIA,to take the responsibility yourself!
a new hope,427,TARKIN,"Princess Leia, before your execution I would like you to be my guest at a ceremony that will make this battle station operational.  No star system will dare oppose the Emperor now."
a new hope,428,LEIA,"The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers."
a new hope,429,TARKIN,"Not after we demonstrate the power of this station.  In a way, you have determined the choice of the planet that'll be destroyed first.  Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the Rebel base, I have chosen to test this station's destructive power... on your home planet of Alderaan."
a new hope,430,LEIA,No!  Alderaan is peaceful.  We have no weapons.  You can't possibly...
a new hope,431,TARKIN,You would prefer another target?  A military target?  Then name the system!
a new hope,432,TARKIN,I grow tired of asking this.  So it'll be the last time.  Where is the Rebel base?
a new hope,433,LEIA,Dantooine.
a new hope,434,LEIA,They're on Dantooine.
a new hope,435,TARKIN,"There.  You see Lord Vader, she can be reasonable. Continue with the operation.  You may fire when ready."
a new hope,436,LEIA,What?
a new hope,437,TARKIN,You're far too trusting.  Dantooine is too remote to make an effective demonstration.  But don't worry.  We will deal with your Rebel friends soon enough.
a new hope,438,LEIA,No!
a new hope,439,VADER,Commence primary ignition.
a new hope,440,LUKE,Are you all right?  What's wrong?
a new hope,441,BEN,I felt a great disturbance in the Force... as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced.  I fear something terrible has happened.
a new hope,442,BEN,You'd better get on with your exercises.
a new hope,443,HAN,"Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.  I told you I'd outrun 'em."
a new hope,444,HAN,Don't everyone thank me at once.
a new hope,445,HAN,"Anyway, we should be at Alderaan about oh-two-hundred hours."
a new hope,446,THREEPIO,"Now be careful, Artoo."
a new hope,447,THREEPIO,He made a fair move.  Screaming about it won't help you.
a new hope,448,HAN,Let him have it. It's not wise to upset a Wookiee.
a new hope,449,THREEPIO,"But sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid."
a new hope,450,HAN,That's 'cause droids don't pull people's arms out of their socket when they lose.  Wookiees are known to do that.
a new hope,451,THREEPIO,"I see your point, sir.  I suggest a new strategy, Artoo.  Let the Wookiee win."
a new hope,452,BEN,"Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him."
a new hope,453,LUKE,You mean it controls your actions?
a new hope,454,BEN,Partially. But it also obeys your commands.
a new hope,455,HAN,"Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid."
a new hope,456,LUKE,"You don't believe in the Force, do you?"
a new hope,457,HAN,"Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other.  I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything.  There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny."
a new hope,458,HAN,It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.
a new hope,459,BEN,"I suggest you try it again, Luke."
a new hope,460,BEN,"This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct."
a new hope,461,LUKE,"With the blast shield down, I can't even see.  How am I supposed to fight?"
a new hope,462,BEN,Your eyes can deceive you.  Don't trust them.
a new hope,463,BEN,Stretch out with your feelings.
a new hope,464,BEN,"You see, you can do it."
a new hope,465,HAN,I call it luck.
a new hope,466,BEN,"In my experience, there's no such thing as luck."
a new hope,467,HAN,"Look, going good against remotes is one thing.  Going good against the living?  That's something else."
a new hope,468,HAN,Looks like we're coming up on Alderaan.
a new hope,469,LUKE,"You know, I did feel something.  I could almost see the remote."
a new hope,470,BEN,That's good.  You have taken your first step into a larger world.
a new hope,471,TARKIN,Yes.
a new hope,472,OFFICER CASS,"Our scout ships have reached Dantooine.  They found the remains of a Rebel base, but they estimate that it has been deserted for some time.  They are now conducting an extensive search of the surrounding systems."
a new hope,473,TARKIN,She lied!  She lied to us!
a new hope,474,VADER,I told you she would never consciously betray the Rebellion.
a new hope,475,TARKIN,Terminate her... immediately!
a new hope,476,HAN,"Stand by, Chewie, here we go.  Cut in the sublight engines."
a new hope,477,HAN,"What the...?  Aw, we've come out of hyperspace into a meteor shower.  Some kind of asteroid collision.  It's not on any of the charts."
a new hope,478,LUKE,What's going on?
a new hope,479,HAN,"Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!"
a new hope,480,LUKE,What do you mean?  Where is it?
a new hope,481,HAN,"Thats what I'm trying to tell you, kid.  It ain't there.  It's been totally blown away."
a new hope,482,LUKE,What?  How?
a new hope,483,BEN,Destroyed... by the Empire!
a new hope,484,HAN,The entire starfleet couldn't destroy the whole planet.  It'd take a thousand ships with more fire power than I've...
a new hope,485,HAN,There's another ship coming in.
a new hope,486,LUKE,Maybe they know what happened.
a new hope,487,BEN,It's an Imperial fighter.
a new hope,488,LUKE,It followed us!
a new hope,489,BEN,No.  It's a short range fighter.
a new hope,490,HAN,There aren't any bases around here.  Where did it come from?
a new hope,491,LUKE,"It sure is leaving in a big hurry.  If they identify us, we're in big trouble."
a new hope,492,HAN,Not if I can help it.  Chewie... jam it's transmissions.
a new hope,493,BEN,It'd be as well to let it go.  It's too far out of range.
a new hope,494,HAN,Not for long...
a new hope,495,BEN,A fighter that size couldn't get this deep into space on its own.
a new hope,496,LUKE,"Then he must have gotten lost, been part of a convoy or something..."
a new hope,497,HAN,"Well, he ain't going to be around long enough to tell anyone about us."
a new hope,498,LUKE,Look at him.  He's heading for that small moon.
a new hope,499,HAN,I think I can get him before he gets there... he's almost in range.
a new hope,500,BEN,That's no moon!  It's a space station.
a new hope,501,HAN,It's too big to be a space station.
a new hope,502,LUKE,I have a very bad feeling about this.
a new hope,503,BEN,Turn the ship around!
a new hope,504,HAN,"Yeah, I think your right.  Full reverse!  Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power."
a new hope,505,LUKE,Why are we still moving towards it?
a new hope,506,HAN,We're caught in a tractor beam!  It's pulling us in!
a new hope,507,LUKE,But there's gotta be something you can do!
a new hope,508,HAN,"There's nothin' I can do about it, kid.  I'm in full power.  I'm going to have to shut down.  But they're not going to get me without a fight!"
a new hope,509,BEN,You can't win.  But there are alternatives to fighting.
a new hope,510,VOICE OVER DEATH STAR INTERCOM,Clear Bay twenty-three-seven.  We are opening the magnetic field.
a new hope,511,OFFICER,To your stations!
a new hope,512,OFFICER,Come with me.
a new hope,513,OFFICER,Close all outboard shields!  Close all outboard shields!
a new hope,514,TARKIN,Yes.
a new hope,515,VOICE,We've captured a freighter entering the remains of the Alderaan system.  It's markings match those of a ship that blasted its way out of Mos Eisley.
a new hope,516,VADER,They must be trying to return the stolen plans to the princess.  She may yet be of some use to us.
a new hope,517,VOICE,Unlock one-five-seven and nine. Release charges.
a new hope,518,OFFICER,"There's no one on board, sir.  According to the log, the crew abandoned ship right after takeoff.  It must be a decoy, sir.  Several of the escape pods have been jettisoned."
a new hope,519,VADER,Did you find any droids?
a new hope,520,OFFICER,"No, sir.  If there were any on board, they must also have jettisoned."
a new hope,521,VADER,Send a scanning crew on board.  I want every part of this ship checked.
a new hope,522,OFFICER,"Yes, sir."
a new hope,523,VADER,I sense something... a presence I haven't felt since...
a new hope,524,OFFICER,Get me a scanning crew in here on the double.  I want every part of this ship checked!
a new hope,525,LUKE,"Boy, it's lucky you had these compartments."
a new hope,526,HAN,"I use them for smuggling.  I never thought I'd be smuggling myself in them.  This is ridiculous.  Even if I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam."
a new hope,527,BEN,Leave that to me!
a new hope,528,HAN,Damn fool. I knew that you were going to say that!
a new hope,529,BEN,Who's the more foolish... the fool or the fool who follows him?
a new hope,530,TROOPER,"The ship's all yours.  If the scanners pick up anything, report it immediately.  All right, let's go."
a new hope,531,HAN'S VOICE,"Hey down there, could you give us a hand with this?"
a new hope,532,GANTRY OFFICER,"TX-four-one-two.  Why aren't you at your post?  TX-four-one-two, do you copy?"
a new hope,533,GANTRY OFFICER,Take over.  We've got a bad transmitter.  I'll see what I can do.
a new hope,534,LUKE,"You know, between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, it's a wonder the whole station doesn't know we're here."
a new hope,535,HAN,Bring them on!  I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around.
a new hope,536,THREEPIO,"We found the computer outlet, sir."
a new hope,537,BEN,Plug in.  He should be able to interpret the entire Imperial computer network.
a new hope,538,THREEPIO,He says he's found the main control to the power beam that's holding the ship here.  He'll try to make the precise location appear on the monitor.
a new hope,539,THREEPIO,The tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven locations.  A power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave.
a new hope,540,BEN,I don't think you boys can help.  I must go alone.
a new hope,541,HAN,Whatever you say.  I've done more than I bargained for on this trip already.
a new hope,542,LUKE,I want to go with you.
a new hope,543,BEN,"Be patient, Luke.  Stay and watch over the droids."
a new hope,544,LUKE,But he can...
a new hope,545,BEN,They must be delivered safely or other star systems will suffer the same fate as Alderaan.  Your destiny lies along a different path from mine.  The Force will be with you... always!
a new hope,546,HAN,"Boy you said it, Chewie."
a new hope,547,HAN,Where did you dig up that old fossil?
a new hope,548,LUKE,Ben is a great man.
a new hope,549,HAN,"Yeah, great at getting us into trouble."
a new hope,550,LUKE,I didn't hear you give any ideas...
a new hope,551,HAN,"Well, anything would be better than just hanging around waiting for them to pick us up..."
a new hope,552,LUKE,Who do you think...
a new hope,553,LUKE,What is it?
a new hope,554,THREEPIO,"I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir. He says ""I found her,"" and keepsrepeating, ""She's here."""
a new hope,555,LUKE,"Well, who... who has he found?"
a new hope,556,THREEPIO,Princess Leia.
a new hope,557,LUKE,The princess?  She's here?
a new hope,558,HAN,Princess?
a new hope,559,LUKE,Where... where is she?
a new hope,560,HAN,Princess?  What's going on?
a new hope,561,THREEPIO,Level five. Detention block AA-twenty-three.  I'm afraid she's scheduled to be terminated.
a new hope,562,LUKE,"Oh, no!  We've got to do something."
a new hope,563,HAN,What are you talking about?
a new hope,564,LUKE,The droid belongs to her.  She's the one in the message.  We've got to help her.
a new hope,565,HAN,"Now, look, don't get any funny ideas.  The old man wants us to wait right here."
a new hope,566,LUKE,"But he didn't know she was here.  Look, will you just find a way back into the detention block?"
a new hope,567,HAN,I'm not going anywhere.
a new hope,568,LUKE,"They're going to execute her.  Look, a few minutes ago you said you didn't want to just wait here to be captured.  Now all you want to do is stay."
a new hope,569,HAN,Marching into the detention area is not what I had in mind.
a new hope,570,LUKE,But they're going to kill her!
a new hope,571,HAN,Better her than me...
a new hope,572,LUKE,She's rich.
a new hope,573,HAN,Rich?
a new hope,574,LUKE,"Yes.  Rich, powerful!  Listen, if you were to rescue her, the reward would be..."
a new hope,575,HAN,What?
a new hope,576,LUKE,Well more wealth that you can imagine.
a new hope,577,HAN,"I don't know, I can imagine quite a bit!"
a new hope,578,LUKE,You'll get it!
a new hope,579,HAN,I better!
a new hope,580,LUKE,You will...
a new hope,581,HAN,"All right, kid.  But you'd better be right about this!"
a new hope,582,LUKE,All right.
a new hope,583,HAN,What's your plan?
a new hope,584,LUKE,"Uh... Threepio, hand me those binders there will you?"
a new hope,585,LUKE,"Okay.  Now, I'm going to put these on you."
a new hope,586,LUKE,"Okay.  Han, you put these on."
a new hope,587,HAN,"Don't worry, Chewie.  I think I know what he has in mind."
a new hope,588,THREEPIO,"Master Luke, sir!  Pardon me for asking... but, ah... what should Artoo and I do if we're discovered here?"
a new hope,589,LUKE,Lock the door!
a new hope,590,HAN,And hope they don't have blasters.
a new hope,591,THREEPIO,That isn't very reassuring.
a new hope,592,LUKE,I can't see a thing in this helmet.
a new hope,593,HAN,This is not going to work.
a new hope,594,LUKE,Why didn't you say so before?
a new hope,595,HAN,I did say so before!
a new hope,596,OFFICER,Where are you taking this... thing?
a new hope,597,LUKE,Prisoner transfer from Block one-one-three-eight.
a new hope,598,OFFICER,I wasn't notified.  I'll have to clear it.
a new hope,599,HAN,Look out!  He's loose!
a new hope,600,LUKE,He's going to pull us all apart.
a new hope,601,HAN,Go get him!
a new hope,602,HAN,We've got to find out which cell this princess of yours is in.  Here it is... cell twenty-one-eight-seven.  You go get her.  I'll hold them here.
a new hope,603,HAN,Everything is under control.  Situation normal.
a new hope,604,INTERCOM VOICE,What happened?
a new hope,605,HAN,"Uh... had a slight weapons malfunction.  But, uh, everything's perfectly all right now.  We're fine.  We're all fine here, now, thank you.  How are you?"
a new hope,606,INTERCOM VOICE,We're sending a squad up.
a new hope,607,HAN,"Uh, uh, negative, negative.  We had a reactor leak here now.  Give us a few minutes to lock it down.  Large leak... very dangerous."
a new hope,608,INTERCOM VOICE,Who is this?  What's your operating number?
a new hope,609,HAN,Boring conversation anyway.Luke!  We're going to have company!
a new hope,610,LEIA,Aren't you a little short for a stormtrooper?
a new hope,611,LUKE,What?  Oh... the uniform.  I'm Luke Skywalker.  I'm here to rescue you.
a new hope,612,LEIA,You're who?
a new hope,613,LUKE,I'm here to rescue you.  I've got your R2 unit.  I'm here with Ben Kenobi.
a new hope,614,LEIA,Ben Kenobi is here!  Where is he?
a new hope,615,LUKE,Come on!
a new hope,616,VADER,He is here...
a new hope,617,TARKIN,Obi-Wan Kenobi!  What makes you think so?
a new hope,618,VADER,A tremor in the Force.  The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.
a new hope,619,TARKIN,Surely he must be dead by now.
a new hope,620,VADER,Don't underestimate the Force.
a new hope,621,TARKIN,"The Jedi are extinct, their fire has gone out of the universe.  You, my friend, are all that's left of their religion."
a new hope,622,TARKIN,Yes.
a new hope,623,INTERCOM VOICE,"Governor Tarkin, we have an emergency alert in detention block AA-twenty-three."
a new hope,624,TARKIN,The princess!  Put all sections on alert!
a new hope,625,VADER,Obi-Wan is here.  The Force is with him.
a new hope,626,TARKIN,"If you're right, he must not be allowed to escape."
a new hope,627,VADER,Escape may not his plan.  I must face him alone.
a new hope,628,HAN,Chewie!
a new hope,629,HAN,Get behind me!  Get behind me!
a new hope,630,HAN,Can't get out that way.
a new hope,631,LEIA,Looks like you managed to cut off our only escape route.
a new hope,632,HAN,"Maybe you'd like it back in your cell, Your Highness."
a new hope,633,LUKE,See-Threepio!  See-Threepio!
a new hope,634,THREEPIO,Yes sir?
a new hope,635,LUKE,We've been cut off!  Are there any other ways out of the cell bay?...What was that?  I didn't copy!
a new hope,636,THREEPIO,"I said, all systems have been alerted to your presence, sir.  The main entrance seems to be the only way out; all other information on your level is restricted."
a new hope,637,TROOPER VOICE,Open up in there!
a new hope,638,THREEPIO,"Oh, no!"
a new hope,639,LUKE,There isn't any other way out.
a new hope,640,HAN,I can't hold them off forever!  Now what?
a new hope,641,LEIA,"This is some rescue.  When you came in here, didn't you have a plan for getting out?"
a new hope,642,HAN,"He's the brains, sweetheart."
a new hope,643,LUKE,"Well, I didn't..."
a new hope,644,HAN,What the hell are you doing?
a new hope,645,LEIA,"Somebody has to save our skins.  Into the garbage chute, wise guy."
a new hope,646,HAN,Get in there you big furry oaf!  I don't care what you smell!  Get in there and don't worry about it.
a new hope,647,HAN,Wonderful girl!  Either I'm going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her.  Get in there!
a new hope,648,HAN,Oh!  The garbage chute was a really wonderful idea.  What an incredible smell you've discovered!  Let's get out of here!  Get away from there...
a new hope,649,LUKE,No!  wait!
a new hope,650,LUKE,Will you forget it?  I already tried it.  It's magnetically sealed!
a new hope,651,LEIA,Put that thing away!  You're going to get us all killed.
a new hope,652,HAN,"Absolutely, Your Worship.  Look, I had everything under control until you led us down here.  You know, it's not going to take them long to figure out what happened to us."
a new hope,653,LEIA,It could be worse...
a new hope,654,HAN,It's worse.
a new hope,655,LUKE,There's something alive in here!
a new hope,656,HAN,That's your imagination.
a new hope,657,LUKE,Something just moves past my leg!  Look!  Did you see that?
a new hope,658,HAN,What?
a new hope,659,LUKE,Help!
a new hope,660,HAN,Luke!  Luke!  Luke!
a new hope,661,LEIA,Luke!
a new hope,662,LEIA,"Luke, Luke, grab a hold of this."
a new hope,663,LUKE,"Blast it, will you!  My gun's jammed."
a new hope,664,HAN,Where?
a new hope,665,LUKE,Anywhere!  Oh!!
a new hope,666,HAN,Luke!  Luke!
a new hope,667,LEIA,Grab him!
a new hope,668,LEIA,What happened?
a new hope,669,LUKE,"I don't know, it just let go of me and disappeared..."
a new hope,670,HAN,I've got a very bad feeling about this.
a new hope,671,LUKE,The walls are moving!
a new hope,672,LEIA,Don't just stand there.  Try and brace it with something.
a new hope,673,LUKE,Wait a minute!
a new hope,674,LUKE,Threepio!  Come in Threepio!  Threepio!  Where could he be?
a new hope,675,FIRST TROOPER,Take over!See to him!  Look there!
a new hope,676,THREEPIO,"They're madmen!  They're heading for the prison level.  If you hurry, you might catch them."
a new hope,677,FIRST OFFICER,Follow me!  You stand guard.
a new hope,678,THREEPIO,Come on!
a new hope,679,THREEPIO,"Oh!  All this excitement has overrun the circuits of my counterpart here.  If you don't mind, I'd like to take him down to maintenance."
a new hope,680,TROOPER,All right.
a new hope,681,LUKE,"Threepio!  Come in, Threepio!  Threepio!"
a new hope,682,HAN,Get to the top!
a new hope,683,LEIA,I can't
a new hope,684,LUKE,"Where could he be?  Threepio!  Threepio, will you come in?"
a new hope,685,THREEPIO,They aren't here!  Something must have happened to them.  See if they've been captured.
a new hope,686,THREEPIO,Hurry!
a new hope,687,HAN,One thing's for sure.  We're all going to be a lot thinner!Get on top of it!
a new hope,688,LEIA,I'm trying!
a new hope,689,THREEPIO,"Thank goodness, they haven't found them!  Where could they be?"
a new hope,690,THREEPIO,"Use the comlink?  Oh, my!  I forgot I turned it off!"
a new hope,691,THREEPIO,"Are you there, sir?"
a new hope,692,LUKE,Threepio!
a new hope,693,THREEPIO,We've had some problems...
a new hope,694,LUKE,"Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level, will you?  Do you copy?"
a new hope,695,LUKE,Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level.
a new hope,696,LUKE,Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level.
a new hope,697,THREEPIO,No.  Shut them all down!  Hurry!
a new hope,698,THREEPIO,"Listen to them!  They're dying, Artoo!  Curse my metal body!  I wasn't fast enough.  It's all my fault!  My poor master!"
a new hope,699,LUKE,"Threepio, we're all right!"
a new hope,700,LUKE,We're all right.  You did great.
a new hope,701,LUKE,"Hey... hey, open the pressure maintenance hatch on unit number... where are we?"
a new hope,702,HAN,Three-two-six-eight-two-seven.
a new hope,703,HAN,"If we can just avoid any more female advice, we ought to be able to get out of here."
a new hope,704,LUKE,"Well, let's get moving!"
a new hope,705,HAN,Where are you going?
a new hope,706,LEIA,"No, wait.  They'll hear!"
a new hope,707,HAN,"Come here, you big coward!"
a new hope,708,HAN,Chewie!  Come here!
a new hope,709,LEIA,"Listen. I don't know who you are, or where you came from, but from now on, you do as I tell you.  Okay?"
a new hope,710,HAN,"Look, Your Worshipfulness, let's get one thing straight!  I takeorders from one person!  Me!"
a new hope,711,LEIA,It's a wonder you're still alive.Will somebody get this big walking carpet out of my way?
a new hope,712,HAN,No reward is worth this.
a new hope,713,OFFICER,Secure this area until the alert is canceled.
a new hope,714,FIRST TROOPER,Give me regular reports.
a new hope,715,FIRST TROOPER,Do you know what's going on?
a new hope,716,SECOND TROOPER,Maybe it's another drill.
a new hope,717,SECOND TROOPER,What was that?
a new hope,718,FIRST TROOPER,"Oh, it's nothing.  Don't worry about it."
a new hope,719,HAN,There she is.
a new hope,720,LUKE,"See-Threepio, do you copy?"
a new hope,721,THREEPIO,"For the moment.  Uh, we're in the main hangar across from the ship."
a new hope,722,LUKE,We're right above you.  Stand by.
a new hope,723,LEIA,You came in that thing?  You're braver that I thought.
a new hope,724,HAN,Nice!  Come on!
a new hope,725,FIRST TROOPER,It's them!  Blast them!
a new hope,726,HAN,Get back to the ship!
a new hope,727,LUKE,Where are you going?  Come back!
a new hope,728,LEIA,He certainly has courage.
a new hope,729,LUKE,What good will it do us if he gets himself killed?  Come on!
a new hope,730,LUKE,I think we took a wrong turn.
a new hope,731,LEIA,There's no lock!
a new hope,732,LUKE,That oughta hold it for a while.
a new hope,733,LEIA,"Quick, we've got to get across.  Find the control that extends the bridge."
a new hope,734,LUKE,"Oh, I think I just blasted it."
a new hope,735,LEIA,They're coming through!
a new hope,736,LUKE,"Here, hold this."
a new hope,737,LEIA,Here they come!
a new hope,738,LEIA,For luck!
a new hope,739,THREEPIO,Where could they be?
a new hope,740,TROOPER,Close the blast doors!
a new hope,741,TROOPER,Open the blast doors!  Open the blast doors!
a new hope,742,VADER,"I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan.  We meet again, at last.  The circle is now complete."
a new hope,743,VADER,"When I left you, I was but the learner; now I am the master."
a new hope,744,BEN,"Only a master of evil, Darth."
a new hope,745,VADER,"Your powers are weak, old man."
a new hope,746,BEN,"You can't win, Darth.  If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine."
a new hope,747,HAN,Didn't we just leave this party?
a new hope,748,HAN,What kept you?
a new hope,749,LEIA,We ran into some old friends.
a new hope,750,LUKE,Is the ship all right?
a new hope,751,HAN,"Seems okay, if we can get to it.Just hope the old man got the tractor beam out of commission."
a new hope,752,LUKE,Look!
a new hope,753,THREEPIO,"Come on, Artoo, we're going!"
a new hope,754,HAN,Now's our chance!  Go!
a new hope,755,LUKE,No!
a new hope,756,HAN,Come on!
a new hope,757,LEIA,"Come on!  Luke, its too late!"
a new hope,758,HAN,Blast the door!  Kid!
a new hope,759,BEN'S VOICE,"Run, Luke!  Run!"
a new hope,760,HAN,"I hope the old man got that tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to be a real short trip.  Okay, hit it!"
a new hope,761,HAN,We're coming up on the sentry ships.  Hold 'em off!  Angle the deflector shields while I charge up the main guns!
a new hope,762,LUKE,I can't believe he's gone.
a new hope,763,LEIA,There wasn't anything you could have done.
a new hope,764,HAN,"Come on, buddy, we're not out of this yet!"
a new hope,765,HAN,"You in, kid?  Okay, stay sharp!"
a new hope,766,LEIA,Here they come!
a new hope,767,LUKE,They're coming in too fast!
a new hope,768,THREEPIO,Oooh!
a new hope,769,LEIA,We've lost lateral controls.
a new hope,770,HAN,"Don't worry, she'll hold together."
a new hope,771,HAN,"You hear me, baby?  Hold together!"
a new hope,772,LUKE,Got him!  I got him!
a new hope,773,HAN,Great kid!  Don't get cocky.
a new hope,774,LEIA,There are still two more of them out there!
a new hope,775,LUKE,That's it!  We did it!
a new hope,776,LEIA,We did it!
a new hope,777,THREEPIO,Help!  I think I'm melting!This is all your fault.
a new hope,778,TARKIN,Are they away?
a new hope,779,VADER,They have just made the jump into hyperspace.
a new hope,780,TARKIN,"You're sure the homing beacon is secure aboard their ship?  I'm taking an awful risk, Vader.  This had better work."
a new hope,781,HAN,"Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh?  You know, sometimes I even amaze myself."
a new hope,782,LEIA,"That doesn't sound too hard.  Besides, they let us go.  It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape."
a new hope,783,HAN,Easy... you call that easy?
a new hope,784,LEIA,Their tracking us!
a new hope,785,HAN,"Not this ship, sister."
a new hope,786,LEIA,At least the information in Artoo is still intact.
a new hope,787,HAN,What's so important?  What's he carrying?
a new hope,788,LEIA,"The technical readouts of that battle station.  I only hope that when the data is analyzed, a weakness can be found.  It's not over yet!"
a new hope,789,HAN,"It is for me, sister!  Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess.  I expect to be well paid.  I'm in it for the money!"
a new hope,790,LEIA,"You needn't worry about your reward.  If money is all that you love, then that's what you'll receive!"
a new hope,791,LEIA,Your friend is quite a mercenary.  I wonder if he really cares about anything... or anyone.
a new hope,792,LUKE,I care!
a new hope,793,LUKE,"So... what do you think of her, Han?"
a new hope,794,HAN,"I'm trying not to, kid!"
a new hope,795,LUKE,Good...
a new hope,796,HAN,"Still, she's got a lot of spirit.  I don't know, what do you think?  Do you think a princess and a guy like me..."
a new hope,797,LUKE,No!
a new hope,798,WILLARD,You're safe!  We had feared the worst.
a new hope,799,WILLARD,"When we heard about Alderaan, we were afraid that you were... lost along with your father."
a new hope,800,LEIA,"We don't have time for our sorrows, commander.  The battle station has surely tracked us here.It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape.  You must use the information in this R2 unit to plan the attack.  It is our only hope."
a new hope,801,TARKIN,Yes.
a new hope,802,DEATH STAR INTERCOM VOICE,We are approaching the planet Yavin.  The Rebel base is on a moon on the far side.  We are preparing to orbit the planet.
a new hope,803,DODONNA,The battle station is heavily shielded and carries a firepower greater than half the star fleet.Its defenses are designed around a direct large-scale assault.  A small one-man fighter should be able to penetrate the outer defense.
a new hope,804,GOLD LEADER,"Pardon me for asking, sir, but what good are snub fighters going to be against that?"
a new hope,805,DODONNA,"Well, the Empire doesn't consider a small one-man fighter to be any threat, or they'd have a tighter defense.  An analysis of the plans provided by Princess Leia has demonstrated a weakness in the battle station."
a new hope,806,DODONNA,"The approach will not be easy.  You are required to maneuver straight down this trench and skim the surface to this point.  The target area is only two meters wide.  It's a small thermal exhaust port, right below the main port.  The shaft leads directly to the reactor system.  A precise hit will start a chain reaction which should destroy the station."
a new hope,807,DODONNA,"Only a precise hit will set up a chain reaction.  The shaft is ray-shielded, so you'll have to use proton torpedoes."
a new hope,808,WEDGE,"That's impossible, even for a computer."
a new hope,809,LUKE,It's not impossible.  I used to bullseye womp rats in my T-sixteen back home.  They're not much bigger than two meters.
a new hope,810,DODONNA,Man your ships!  And may the Force be with you!
a new hope,811,DEATH STAR INTERCOM VOICE,Orbiting the planet at maximum velocity.  The moon with the Rebel base will be in range in thirty minutes.
a new hope,812,VADER,This will be a day long remembered.  It has seen the end of Kenobi and it will soon see the end of the Rebellion.
a new hope,813,MAN'S VOICE,"All flight troops, man your stations.  All flight troops, man your stations."
a new hope,814,LUKE,So... you got your reward and you're just leaving then?
a new hope,815,HAN,"That's right, yeah!  I got some old debts I've got to pay off with this stuff.  Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be fool enough to stick around here, do you?  Why don't you come with us?  You're pretty good in a fight.  I could use you."
a new hope,816,LUKE,"Come on!  Why don't you take a look around?  You know what's about to happen, what they're up against.  They could use a good pilot like you.  You're turning your back on them."
a new hope,817,HAN,"What good's a reward if you ain't around to use it?  Besides, attacking that battle station ain'tmy idea of courage.  It's more like suicide."
a new hope,818,LUKE,"All right.  Well, take care of yourself, Han... guess that's what you're best at, isn't it?"
a new hope,819,HAN,"Hey, Luke... may the Force be with you!"
a new hope,820,HAN,What're you lookin' at?  I know what I'm doing.
a new hope,821,LEIA,What's wrong?
a new hope,822,LUKE,"Oh, it's Han!  I don't know, I really thought he'd change his mind."
a new hope,823,LEIA,He's got to follow his own path.  No one can choose it for him.
a new hope,824,LUKE,I only wish Ben were here.
a new hope,825,BIGGS,Luke!  I don't believe it!  How'd you get here... are you going out with us?!
a new hope,826,LUKE,"Biggs!  Of course, I'll be up there with you!  Listen, have I got some stories to tell..."
a new hope,827,RED LEADER,Are you... Luke Skywalker?  Have you been checked out on the Incom T-sixty-five?
a new hope,828,BIGGS,"Sir, Luke is the best bushpilot in the outer rim territories."
a new hope,829,RED LEADER,"I met your father once when I was just a boy.  He was a great pilot.  You'll do all right.  If you've got half of your father's skill, you'll do better than all right."
a new hope,830,LUKE,"Thank you, sir.  I'll try."
a new hope,831,BIGGS,"I've got to get aboard.  Listen, you'll tell me your stories when we come back.  All right?"
a new hope,832,LUKE,"I told you I'd make it someday, Biggs."
a new hope,833,BIGGS,"You did, all right.  It's going to be like old times Luke. We're a couple of shooting stars that'll never be stopped!"
a new hope,834,CHIEF,This R2 unit of your seems a bit beat up.  Do you want a new one?
a new hope,835,LUKE,"Not on your life!  That little droid and I have been through a lot together.You okay, Artoo?"
a new hope,836,CHIEF,"Okay, easy she goes!"
a new hope,837,THREEPIO,"Hang on tight, Artoo, you've got to come back."
a new hope,838,THREEPIO,"You wouldn't want my life to get boring, would you?"
a new hope,839,BEN'S VOICE,"Luke, the Force will be with you."
a new hope,840,MASSASSI INTERCOM VOICE,"Stand-by alert.  Death Star approaching.  Estimated time to firing range, fifteen minutes."
a new hope,841,RED LEADER,All wings report in.
a new hope,842,RED TEN,Red Ten standing by.
a new hope,843,RED SEVEN,Red Seven standing by.
a new hope,844,BIGGS,Red Three standing by.
a new hope,845,PORKINS,Red Six standing by.
a new hope,846,RED NINE,Red Nine standing by.

a new hope,848,RED ELEVEN,Red Eleven standing by.
a new hope,849,LUKE,Red Five standing by.
a new hope,850,RED LEADER,Lock S-foils in attack position.
a new hope,851,RED LEADER,We're passing through their magnetic field.
a new hope,852,RED LEADER,Hold tight!
a new hope,853,RED LEADER,Switch your deflectors on.
a new hope,854,RED LEADER,Double front!
a new hope,855,WEDGE,Look at the size of that thing!
a new hope,856,RED LEADER,"Cut the chatter, Red Two."
a new hope,857,RED LEADER,"Accelerate to attack speed.  This is it, boys!"
a new hope,858,GOLD LEADER,"Red Leader, this is Gold Leader."
a new hope,859,RED LEADER,"I copy, Gold Leader."
a new hope,860,GOLD LEADER,We're starting for the target shaft now.
a new hope,861,RED LEADER,We're in position.  I'm going to cut across the axis and try and draw their fire.
a new hope,862,WEDGE,"Heavy fire, boss!  Twenty-threedegrees."
a new hope,863,RED LEADER,I see it.  Stay low.
a new hope,864,LUKE,This is Red Five!  I'm going in!
a new hope,865,BIGGS,"Luke, pull up!"
a new hope,866,BIGGS,Are you all right?
a new hope,867,LUKE,"I got a little cooked, but I'm okay."
a new hope,868,ASTRO-OFFICER,"We count thirty Rebel ships, Lord Vader.  But they're so small they're evading our turbo-lasers!"
a new hope,869,VADER,We'll have to destroy them ship to ship.  Get the crews to their fighters.
a new hope,870,RED LEADER,"Luke, let me know when you're going in."
a new hope,871,LUKE,I'm on my way in now...
a new hope,872,RED LEADER,Watch yourself!  There's a lot of fire coming from the right side of that deflection tower.
a new hope,873,LUKE,I'm on it.
a new hope,874,CONTROL OFFICER,"Squad leaders, we've picked up a new group of signals.  Enemy fighters coming your way."
a new hope,875,LUKE,My scope's negative.  I don't see anything.
a new hope,876,RED LEADER,"Keep up your visual scanning.  With all this jamming, they'll be on top of you before your scope can pick them up."
a new hope,877,RED LEADER,Biggs!  You've picked one up... watch it!
a new hope,878,BIGGS,I can't see it!  Where is he?!
a new hope,879,BIGGS,"He's on me tight, I can't shake him... I can't shake him."
a new hope,880,LUKE,"Hang on, Biggs, I'm coming in."
a new hope,881,LUKE,Got him!
a new hope,882,VADER,Several fighters have broken off from the main group.  Come with me!
a new hope,883,BIGGS,Pull in!  Luke... pull in!
a new hope,884,WEDGE,"Watch your back, Luke!"
a new hope,885,WEDGE,"Watch your back!  Fighter's above you, coming in!"
a new hope,886,LUKE,"I'm hit, but not bad."
a new hope,887,LUKE'S VOICE,"Artoo, see what you can do with it.  Hang on back there."
a new hope,888,RED LEADER,Red Six...
a new hope,889,RED LEADER,Can you see Red Five?
a new hope,890,RED TEN,"There's a heavy fire zone on this side. Red Five, where are you?"
a new hope,891,LUKE,I can't shake him!
a new hope,892,WEDGE,"I'm on him, Luke!"
a new hope,893,WEDGE,Hold on!
a new hope,894,LUKE,Blast it!  Wedge where are you?
a new hope,895,LUKE,"Thanks, Wedge."
a new hope,896,BIGGS,"Good shooting, Wedge!"
a new hope,897,GOLD LEADER,Red Leader...
a new hope,898,GOLD LEADER,... This is Gold Leader.  We're starting out attack run.
a new hope,899,RED LEADER,"I copy, Gold Leader.  Move into position."
a new hope,900,VADER,Stay in attack formation!
a new hope,901,GOLD LEADER,The exhaust post is...
a new hope,902,GOLD LEADER,... marked and locked in!
a new hope,903,GOLD LEADER,Switch power to front deflection screens.
a new hope,904,GOLD LEADER,"How many guns do you think, Gold Five?"
a new hope,905,GOLD FIVE,"I'd say about twenty guns.  Some on the surface, some on the towers."
a new hope,906,MASSASSI INTERCOM VOICE,Death Star will be in range in five minutes.
a new hope,907,GOLD LEADER,Switch to targeting computer.
a new hope,908,GOLD TWO,Computer's locked.  Getting a signal.
a new hope,909,GOLD TWO,The guns... they've stopped!
a new hope,910,GOLD FIVE,Stabilize your rear deflectors.  Watch for enemy fighters.
a new hope,911,GOLD LEADER,They've coming in!  Three marks at two ten.
a new hope,912,VADER,I'll take them myself!  Cover me!
a new hope,913,WINGMAN'S VOICE,"Yes, sir."
a new hope,914,GOLD LEADER,I can't maneuver!
a new hope,915,GOLD FIVE,Stay on target.
a new hope,916,GOLD LEADER,We're too close.
a new hope,917,GOLD FIVE,Stay on target!
a new hope,918,GOLD LEADER,Loosen up!
a new hope,919,GOLD FIVE,Gold Five to Red Leader...
a new hope,920,GOLD FIVE,"Lost Tiree, lost Dutch."
a new hope,921,RED LEADER,"I copy, Gold Five."
a new hope,922,GOLD FIVE,They came from behind....
a new hope,923,OFFICER,"We've analyzed their attack, sir, and there is a danger.  Should I have your ship standing by?"
a new hope,924,TARKIN,Evacuate?  In out moment of triumph?  I think you overestimate their chances!
a new hope,925,VOICE,"Rebel base, three minutes and closing."
a new hope,926,RED LEADER,"Red Group, this is Red Leader."
a new hope,927,RED LEADER,Rendezvous at mark six point one.
a new hope,928,WEDGE,This is Red Two.  Flying towards you.
a new hope,929,BIGGS,"Red Three, standing by."
a new hope,930,DODONNA,"Red Leader, this is Base One.  Keep half your group out of range for the next run."
a new hope,931,RED LEADER'S VOICE,"Copy, Base One.  Luke, take Red Two and Three.  Hold up here and wait for my signal... to start your run."
a new hope,932,RED LEADER,This is it!
a new hope,933,RED TEN,We should be able to see it by now.
a new hope,934,RED LEADER,Keep your eyes open for those fighters!
a new hope,935,RED TEN,There's too much interference!
a new hope,936,RED TEN'S VOICE,"Red Five, can you see them from where you are?"
a new hope,937,LUKE,No sign of any... wait!
a new hope,938,LUKE,Coming in point three five.
a new hope,939,RED TEN,I see them.
a new hope,940,RED LEADER,I'm in range.
a new hope,941,RED LEADER,Target's coming up!
a new hope,942,RED LEADER,Just hold them off for a few seconds.
a new hope,943,VADER,Close up formation.
a new hope,944,RED LEADER,Almost there!
a new hope,945,RED TEN,You'd better let her loose.
a new hope,946,RED LEADER,Almost there!
a new hope,947,RED TEN,I can't hold them!
a new hope,948,RED LEADER,It's away!
a new hope,949,RED NINE'S VOICE,It's a hit!
a new hope,950,RED LEADER,Negative.
a new hope,951,RED LEADER,"Negative!  It didn't go in, it just impacted on the surface."
a new hope,952,LUKE,"Red Leader, we're right above you.  Turn to point..."
a new hope,953,LUKE,... oh-five; we'll cover for you.
a new hope,954,RED LEADER,Stay there...
a new hope,955,RED LEADER,... I just lost my starboard engine.
a new hope,956,RED LEADER,Get set up for your attack run.
a new hope,957,DEATH STAR INTERCOM VOICE,"Rebel base, one minute and closing."
a new hope,958,LUKE,"Biggs, Wedge, let's close it up.  We're going in.  We're going in full throttle."
a new hope,959,WEDGE,"Right with you, boss."
a new hope,960,BIGGS,"Luke, at that speed will you be able to pull out in time?"
a new hope,961,LUKE,It'll be just like Beggar's Canyon back home.
a new hope,962,BIGGS,We'll stay back far enough to cover you.
a new hope,963,WEDGE,"My scope shows the tower, but I can't see the exhaust port!  Are you sure the computer can hit it?"
a new hope,964,LUKE,Watch yourself!  Increase speed full throttle!
a new hope,965,WEDGE,What about that tower?
a new hope,966,LUKE,You worry about those fighters!  I'll worry about the tower!
a new hope,967,LUKE,"Artoo... that, that stabilizer's broken loose again!  See if you can't lock it down!"
a new hope,968,WEDGE,I'm hit!  I can't stay with you.
a new hope,969,LUKE,"Get clear, Wedge."
a new hope,970,LUKE,You can't do any more good back there!
a new hope,971,WEDGE,Sorry!
a new hope,972,VADER,Let him go!  Stay on the leader!
a new hope,973,BIGGS,"Hurry, Luke, they're coming in much faster this time. I can't hold them!"
a new hope,974,LUKE,"Artoo, try and increase the power!"
a new hope,975,BIGGS,"Hurry up, Luke!"
a new hope,976,BIGGS,Wait!
a new hope,977,DEATH STAR INTERCOM VOICE,"Rebel base, thirty seconds and closing."
a new hope,978,VADER,I'm on the leader.
a new hope,979,THREEPIO,"Hang on, Artoo!"
a new hope,980,BEN'S VOICE,"Use the Force, Luke."
a new hope,981,BEN'S VOICE,"Let go, Luke."
a new hope,982,VADER,The Force is strong with this one!
a new hope,983,BEN'S VOICE,"Luke, trust me."
a new hope,984,BASE VOICE,"His computer's off.  Luke, you switched off your targeting computer.  What's wrong?"
a new hope,985,LUKE,Nothing.  I'm all right.
a new hope,986,LUKE,I've lost Artoo!
a new hope,987,MASSASSI INTERCOM VOICE,The Death Star has cleared the planet.  The Death Star has cleared the planet.
a new hope,988,DEATH STAR INTERCOM VOICE,"Rebel base, in range."
a new hope,989,TARKIN,You may fire when ready.
a new hope,990,DEATH STAR INTERCOM VOICE,Commence primary ignition.
a new hope,991,VADER,I have you now.
a new hope,992,VADER,What?
a new hope,993,HAN,Yahoo!
a new hope,994,WINGMAN,Look out!
a new hope,995,HAN,"You're all clear, kid."
a new hope,996,HAN,Now let's blow this thing and go home!
a new hope,997,INTERCOM VOICE,Stand by to fire at Rebel base.
a new hope,998,INTERCOM VOICE,Standing by.
a new hope,999,HAN,"Great shot, kid.  That was one in a million."
a new hope,1000,BEN'S VOICE,"Remember, the Force will be with you... always."
a new hope,1001,LEIA,Luke!  Luke!  Luke!
a new hope,1002,HAN,Hey!  Hey!
a new hope,1003,LUKE,I knew you'd come back!  I just knew it!
a new hope,1004,HAN,"Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all the credit and take all the reward."
a new hope,1005,LEIA,"Hey, I knew there was more to you than money."
a new hope,1006,LUKE,"Oh, no!"
a new hope,1007,THREEPIO,"Oh, my!  Artoo!  Can you hear me?  Say something!You can repair him, can't you?"
a new hope,1008,TECHNICIAN,We'll get to work on him right away.
a new hope,1009,THREEPIO,"You must repair him!  Sir, if any of my circuits or gears will help, I'll gladly donate them."
a new hope,1010,LUKE,He'll be all right.
the empire strikes back,1,LUKE,"Echo Three to Echo Seven. Han, old buddy, do you  read me?"
the empire strikes back,2,HAN,"Loud and clear, kid. What's up?"
the empire strikes back,3,LUKE,"Well, I finished my circle. I don't pick up any  life readings."
the empire strikes back,4,HAN,There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a  space cruiser. The sensors are placed. I'm going back.
the empire strikes back,5,LUKE,Right. I'll see you shortly. There's a meteorite  that hit the ground near here. I want to check it out. It won't take long.
the empire strikes back,6,LUKE,"Hey, steady girl. What's the matter? You smell something?"
the empire strikes back,7,LUKE,Aaargh!
the empire strikes back,8,HAN,Chewie!
the empire strikes back,9,HAN,"All right, don't lose your temper. I'll come right back and give  you a hand."
the empire strikes back,10,RIEEKAN,Solo?
the empire strikes back,11,HAN,"No sign of life out there, General. The sensors are in place.  You'll know if anything comes around."
the empire strikes back,12,RIEEKAN,Commander Skywalker reported in yet?
the empire strikes back,13,HAN,No. He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.
the empire strikes back,14,RIEEKAN,"With all the meteor activity in this  system, it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships."
the empire strikes back,15,HAN,"General, I've got to leave. I can't stay anymore."
the empire strikes back,16,RIEEKAN,I'm sorry to hear that.
the empire strikes back,17,HAN,"Well, there's a price on my head. If I don't pay off Jabba the  Hut, I'm a dead man."
the empire strikes back,18,RIEEKAN,"A death mark's not an easy thing to live with. You're a good  fighter, Solo. I hate to lose you."
the empire strikes back,19,HAN,"Thank you, General."
the empire strikes back,20,HAN,"Well, Your Highness, I guess this is it."
the empire strikes back,21,LEIA,That's right.
the empire strikes back,22,HAN,"Well, don't get all mushy on me. So long, Princess."
the empire strikes back,23,LEIA,Han!
the empire strikes back,24,HAN,"Yes, Your Highnessness?"
the empire strikes back,25,LEIA,I thought you decided to stay.
the empire strikes back,26,HAN,"Well, the bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my  mind."
the empire strikes back,27,LEIA,"Han, we need you!"
the empire strikes back,28,HAN,We?
the empire strikes back,29,LEIA,Yes.
the empire strikes back,30,HAN,"Oh, what about you need?"
the empire strikes back,31,LEIA,I need? I don't know what you're talking about.
the empire strikes back,32,HAN,You probably don't.
the empire strikes back,33,LEIA,And what precisely am I supposed to know?
the empire strikes back,34,HAN,Come on! You want me to stay because of the way you feel about  me.
the empire strikes back,35,LEIA,Yes. You're a great help to us. You're a natural leader...
the empire strikes back,36,HAN,No! That's not it. Come on. Aahhh -- uh huh! Come on.
the empire strikes back,37,LEIA,You're imagining things.
the empire strikes back,38,HAN,Am I? Then why are you following me? Afraid I was going to leave  without giving you a goodbye kiss?
the empire strikes back,39,LEIA,I'd just as soon kiss a Wookiee.
the empire strikes back,40,HAN,I can arrange that. You could use a good kiss!
the empire strikes back,41,THREEPIO,Don't try to blame me. I didn't ask you to turn on the  thermal heater. I merely commented that it was freezing in the princess's chamber. But it's supposed to be freezing. How are we going to dry out all her clothes? I really don't know.
the empire strikes back,42,THREEPIO,"Oh, switch off."
the empire strikes back,43,HAN,Why do you take this apart now? I'm trying to get us  out of here and you pull both of these.
the empire strikes back,44,THREEPIO,"Excuse me, sir."
the empire strikes back,45,HAN,Put them back together right now.
the empire strikes back,46,THREEPIO,"Might I have a word with you, please?"
the empire strikes back,47,HAN,What do you want?
the empire strikes back,48,THREEPIO,"Well, it's Princess Leia, sir. She's been trying to get you  on the communicator."
the empire strikes back,49,HAN,I turned it off. I don't want to talk to her.
the empire strikes back,50,THREEPIO,"Oh. Well, Princess Leia is wondering about Master Luke. He  hasn't come back yet. She doesn't know where he is."
the empire strikes back,51,HAN,I don't know where he is.
the empire strikes back,52,THREEPIO,Nobody knows where he is.
the empire strikes back,53,HAN,"What do you mean, \""nobody knows\""?"
the empire strikes back,54,THREEPIO,"Well, uh, you see..."
the empire strikes back,55,HAN,Deck Officer. Deck Officer!
the empire strikes back,56,THREEPIO,"Excuse me, sir. Might I inqu-..."
the empire strikes back,57,DECK OFFICER,"Yes, sir?"
the empire strikes back,58,HAN,Do you know where Commander Skywalker is?
the empire strikes back,59,DECK OFFICER,I haven't seen him. It's possible he came in through the  south entrance.
the empire strikes back,60,HAN,It's possible? Why don't you go find out? It's getting dark out  there.
the empire strikes back,61,DECK OFFICER,"Yes, sir."
the empire strikes back,62,THREEPIO,"Excuse me, sir. Might I inquire what's going on?"
the empire strikes back,63,HAN,Why not?
the empire strikes back,64,THREEPIO,"Impossible man. Come along, Artoo, lets find Princess Leia.  Between ourselves, I think Master Luke is in considerable danger."
the empire strikes back,65,DECK OFFICER,"Sir, Commander Skywalker hasn't come in through the  south entrance. He might have forgotten to check in."
the empire strikes back,66,HAN,Not likely. Are the speeders ready?
the empire strikes back,67,DECK OFFICER,Not yet. We're having some trouble adapting them to the  cold.
the empire strikes back,68,HAN,Then we'll have to go out on Tauntauns.
the empire strikes back,69,DECK OFFICER,"Sir, the temperature's dropping too rapidly."
the empire strikes back,70,HAN,That's right. And my friends out in it.
the empire strikes back,71,ASSISTANT OFFICER,I'll cover sector twelve. Have com-control set  screen alpha.
the empire strikes back,72,DECK OFFICER,Your Tauntaun'll freeze before you reach the first  marker.
the empire strikes back,73,HAN,Then I'll see you in hell!
the empire strikes back,74,THREEPIO,"You must come along now, Artoo. There's really nothing more  we can do. And my joints are freezing up."
the empire strikes back,75,THREEPIO,"Don't say thing like that! Of course we'll see Master Luke  again. He'll be quite all right, you'll see.  Stupid little short-circuit. He'll be quite all right."
the empire strikes back,76,LIEUTENANT,"Sir, all the patrols are in. There's still no contact from  Skywalker or Solo."
the empire strikes back,77,THREEPIO,"Mistress Leia, Artoo says he's been quite unable to pick up  any signals, although he does admit that his own range is far too weak to abandon all hope."
the empire strikes back,78,DERLIN,"Your Highness, there's nothing more we can do tonight. The  shield doors must be closed."
the empire strikes back,79,DERLIN,Close the doors.
the empire strikes back,80,LIEUTENANT,"Yes, sir."
the empire strikes back,81,THREEPIO,Artoo says the chances of survival are seven hundred  seventy-five...to one.
the empire strikes back,82,THREEPIO,"Actually, Artoo has been known to make mistakes...from time  to time. Oh, dear, oh, dear. Don't worry about Master Luke. I'm sure he'll be all right. He's quite clever, you know...for a human being."
the empire strikes back,83,BEN,Luke...Luke.
the empire strikes back,84,LUKE,Ben?
the empire strikes back,85,BEN,You will go to the Dagobah system.
the empire strikes back,86,LUKE,Dagobah system?
the empire strikes back,87,BEN,"There you will learn from Yoda, the Jedi Master who instructed  me."
the empire strikes back,88,LUKE,Ben...Ben.
the empire strikes back,89,HAN,"Luke! Luke! Don't do this, Luke. Come on, give me a sign here."
the empire strikes back,90,HAN,Not much time.
the empire strikes back,91,LUKE,Ben...Ben...
the empire strikes back,92,HAN,"Hang on, kid."
the empire strikes back,93,LUKE,Dagobah system...
the empire strikes back,94,HAN,Whew...
the empire strikes back,95,LUKE,Dagobah...
the empire strikes back,96,HAN,"This may smell bad, kid..."
the empire strikes back,97,LUKE,Yoda...
the empire strikes back,98,HAN,...but it will keep you warm...til I get the shelter built.   Ooh...I thought they smelled bad on the outside!
the empire strikes back,99,ZEV,"Echo Base...I've got something! Not much, but  it could be a life form."
the empire strikes back,100,ZEV,"This is Rouge Two. this is Rouge Two. Captain  Solo, so you copy? Commander Skywalker, do you copy? This is Rouge Two."
the empire strikes back,101,HAN,Good morning. Nice of you guys to  drop by.
the empire strikes back,102,ZEV,"Echo Base...this is Rouge Two. I found  them. Repeat, I found them."
the empire strikes back,103,THREEPIO,"Master Luke, sir, it's good to see you fully functional  again."
the empire strikes back,104,THREEPIO,"Artoo expresses his relief, also."
the empire strikes back,105,HAN,"How are you feeling, kid? You don't look so bad to me. In fact,  you look strong enough to pull the ears off a Gundark."
the empire strikes back,106,LUKE,Thanks to you.
the empire strikes back,107,HAN,"That's two you owe me, junior."
the empire strikes back,108,HAN,"Well your Worship, looks like you managed to keep me around for a  little while longer."
the empire strikes back,109,LEIA,I had nothing to do with it. General Rieekan thinks  it's dangerous for any ships to leave the system until we've activated the energy shield.
the empire strikes back,110,HAN,That's a good story. I think you just can't bear to let a  gorgeous guy like me out of your sight.
the empire strikes back,111,LEIA,"I don't know where you get you delusions, laser brain."
the empire strikes back,112,HAN,"Laugh it up, fuzz ball. But you didn't see us alone in the south  passage."
the empire strikes back,113,HAN,She expressed her true feelings for me.
the empire strikes back,114,LEIA,"My...! Why, you stuck up,...half-witted,...scruffy-looking...  nerf-herder!"
the empire strikes back,115,HAN,"Who's scruffy-looking?  I must have hit her pretty close  to the mark to get her all riled up like that, huh, kid?"
the empire strikes back,116,LEIA,"Why, I guess you don't know everything about women yet?"
the empire strikes back,117,ANNOUNCER,"Headquarters personnel, report to command  center."
the empire strikes back,118,HAN,Take it easy.
the empire strikes back,119,THREEPIO,"Excuse us, please."
the empire strikes back,120,RIEEKAN,Princess...we have a visitor.
the empire strikes back,121,RIEEKAN,"We've picked up something outside the base in zone twelve,  moving east."
the empire strikes back,122,SENIOR CONTROLLER,It's metal.
the empire strikes back,123,LEIA,Then it couldn't be one of those creatures that attacked Luke.
the empire strikes back,124,HAN,"It could be a speeder, one of ours."
the empire strikes back,125,SENIOR CONTROLLER,No. Wait -- there's something very weak coming  through.
the empire strikes back,126,THREEPIO,"Sir, I am fluent in six million forms of communication. This  signal is not used by the Alliance. It could be an Imperial code."
the empire strikes back,127,HAN,"It isn't friendly, whatever it is. Come on, Chewie, let's check  it out."
the empire strikes back,128,RIEEKAN,Send Rouges Ten and Eleven to station three-eight.
the empire strikes back,129,HAN,Afraid there's not much left.
the empire strikes back,130,LEIA,What was it?
the empire strikes back,131,HAN,Droid of some kind. I didn't hit it that hard. It  must have had a self-destruct.
the empire strikes back,132,LEIA,An Imperial probe droid.
the empire strikes back,133,HAN,It's a good bet the Empire knows we're here.
the empire strikes back,134,RIEEKAN,We'd better start the evacuation.
the empire strikes back,135,PIETT,Admiral.
the empire strikes back,136,OZZEL,"Yes, Captain"
the empire strikes back,137,PIETT,"I think we've got something, sir. The report is only a fragment  had."
the empire strikes back,138,OZZEL,"We have thousands of probe droids searching the  galaxy. I want proof, not leads!"
the empire strikes back,139,PIETT,The visuals indicate life readings.
the empire strikes back,140,OZZEL,It could mean anything. If we followed every lead...
the empire strikes back,141,PIETT,"But, sir, the Hoth system is supposed to be devoid of human  forms."
the empire strikes back,142,VADER,You found something?
the empire strikes back,143,PIETT,"Yes, my lord."
the empire strikes back,144,VADER,That's it. The  Rebels are there.
the empire strikes back,145,OZZEL,"My lord, there are so many uncharted settlements. It could be  smugglers, it could be..."
the empire strikes back,146,VADER,"That is the system. And I'm sure Skywalker is with them. Set  your course for the Hoth system. General Veers, prepare you men."
the empire strikes back,147,REBEL CAPTAIN,"Groups seven and ten will stay behind to fly the  speeders. As soon as each transport is loaded, evacuation control will give clearance for immediate launch."
the empire strikes back,148,REBEL FIGHTER,"Right, sir."
the empire strikes back,149,HAN,"Okay, that's it. Try it...Off! Turn it  off! Turn it off! Off!"
the empire strikes back,150,MEDICAL DROID,"Sir, it will take quite awhile to evacuate the T-forty-  sevens."
the empire strikes back,151,LUKE,"Well, forget the heavy equipment. There's plenty of time to get  the smaller modules on the transports."
the empire strikes back,152,MEDICAL DROID,"Take care, sir."
the empire strikes back,153,LUKE,Thanks.
the empire strikes back,154,LUKE,"Chewie, take care of yourself, okay?"
the empire strikes back,155,HAN,"Hi, kid.  There's got to be a reason for it. Check it  at the other end. Wait a second.  You all right?"
the empire strikes back,156,LUKE,Yeah.
the empire strikes back,157,HAN,Be careful.
the empire strikes back,158,LUKE,"You, too."
the empire strikes back,159,CONTROLLER,"General, there's a fleet of Star Destroyers coming out of  hyperspace in sector four."
the empire strikes back,160,RIEEKAN,Reroute all power to the energy shield. We've got to hold  them till all transports are away. Prepare for ground assault.
the empire strikes back,161,VADER,"What is it, General?"
the empire strikes back,162,VEERS,"My lord, the fleet has moves out of light-speed. Com-Scan has  detected an energy field protecting an area around the sixth planet of the Hoth system. The field is strong enough to deflect any bombardment."
the empire strikes back,163,VADER,The Rebels are alerted to our presence. Admiral Ozzel  came out of light-speed too close to the system.
the empire strikes back,164,VEERS,He felt surprise was wiser...
the empire strikes back,165,VADER,"He is as clumsy as he is stupid. General, prepare your troops  for a surface attack."
the empire strikes back,166,VEERS,"Yes, my lord."
the empire strikes back,167,OZZEL,"Lord Vader, the fleet has moved out of light-speed, and we're  preparing to...Aaagh!"
the empire strikes back,168,VADER,"You have failed me for the last time, Admiral. Captain Piett."
the empire strikes back,169,PIETT,"Yes, my lord."
the empire strikes back,170,VADER,"Make ready to land out troops beyond the energy shield and  deploy the fleet so that nothing gets off that system. You are in command now, Admiral Piett."
the empire strikes back,171,PIETT,"Thank you, Lord Vader."
the empire strikes back,172,LEIA,"All troop carriers will assemble at the north entrance. The  heavy transport ships will leave as soon as they're loaded. Only two fighter escorts per ship. The energy shield can only be opened for a short time, so you'll have to stay very close to your transports."
the empire strikes back,173,HOBBIE,Two fighters against a Star Destroyer?
the empire strikes back,174,LEIA,"The ion cannon will fire several shots to make sure that any  enemy ships will be out of your flight path. When you've gotten past the energy shield, proceed directly to the rendezvous point. Understood?"
the empire strikes back,175,PILOTS,Right. Okay.
the empire strikes back,176,LEIA,Good luck.
the empire strikes back,177,DERLIN,Okay. Everyone to your stations. Let's go!
the empire strikes back,178,RIEEKAN,Their primary target will be the power generators. Prepare to  open the shield.
the empire strikes back,179,CONTROLLER,"Sir, Rebel ships are coming into our sector."
the empire strikes back,180,CAPTAIN,Good. Our first catch of the day.
the empire strikes back,181,WOMAN CONTROLLER,"Stand by, ion control....Fire!"
the empire strikes back,182,ANNOUNCER,The first transport is away.
the empire strikes back,183,DACK,"Feeling all right, sir?"
the empire strikes back,184,LUKE,"Just like new, Dack. How about you?"
the empire strikes back,185,DACK,Right now I feel I could take on the whole Empire myself.
the empire strikes back,186,LUKE,I know what you mean.
the empire strikes back,187,TRENCH OFFICER,Echo Station Three-T-Eight.
the empire strikes back,188,TRENCH OFFICER,We have spotted Imperial walkers!
the empire strikes back,189,CONTROLLER,Imperial walkers on the north ridge.
the empire strikes back,190,LUKE,Echo station Five-Seven. We're on our way.
the empire strikes back,191,LUKE,"All right, boys, keep tight now."
the empire strikes back,192,DACK,"Luke, I have no approach vector. I'm not set."
the empire strikes back,193,LUKE,"Steady, Dack. Attack pattern delta. Go now!"
the empire strikes back,194,LUKE,"All right, I'm coming in."
the empire strikes back,195,LUKE,"Hobbie, you still with me?"
the empire strikes back,196,LUKE,That armor's too strong for blasters.
the empire strikes back,197,LUKE,"Rouge Group, use your harpoons and tow cables. Go  for the legs. It might be our only chance of stopping them.  All right, stand by, Dack."
the empire strikes back,198,DACK,"Luke, we've got a malfunction in fire control. I'll have to cut  in the auxiliary."
the empire strikes back,199,LUKE,"Just hang on. Hang on, Dack. Get ready to fire that tow cable."
the empire strikes back,200,LUKE,Dack? Dack!
the empire strikes back,201,VEERS,"Yes, Lord Vader. I've reached the main power generator. The  shield will be down in moments. You may start your landing."
the empire strikes back,202,LUKE,Rouge Three.
the empire strikes back,203,WEDGE,"Copy, Rouge Leader"
the empire strikes back,204,LUKE,"Wedge, I've lost my gunner. You'll have to make  this shot. I'll cover for you. Set your harpoon. Follow me on the next pass."
the empire strikes back,205,WEDGE,"Coming around, Rouge Leader."
the empire strikes back,206,LUKE,"Steady, Rouge Two"
the empire strikes back,207,WEDGE,Activate harpoon.
the empire strikes back,208,WEDGE,"Good shot, Janson."
the empire strikes back,209,WEDGE,One more pass.
the empire strikes back,210,JANSON,Coming around. Once more.
the empire strikes back,211,JANSON,One more.
the empire strikes back,212,JANSON,Cable out! Let her go!
the empire strikes back,213,WEDGE,Detach cable.
the empire strikes back,214,JANSON,Cable detached.
the empire strikes back,215,TRENCH OFFICER,Come on!
the empire strikes back,216,WEDGE,Whooha!! That got him!
the empire strikes back,217,LUKE,"I see it, Wedge. Good work."
the empire strikes back,218,RIEEKAN,I don't think we can protect two transports at a time.
the empire strikes back,219,LEIA,"It's risky, but we can't hold out much longer. We have no  choice."
the empire strikes back,220,RIEEKAN,Launch patrols.
the empire strikes back,221,LEIA,Evacuate remaining ground staff.
the empire strikes back,222,HAN,"No, no! No! This one goes there, that one goes there. right?"
the empire strikes back,223,THREEPIO,"Artoo, you take good care of Master Luke now, understand?  And...do take care of yourself. Oh, dear, oh, dear."
the empire strikes back,224,VEERS,All troops will debark for ground assault. Prepare to target  the main generator.
the empire strikes back,225,LUKE,"Rouge Two, are you all right?"
the empire strikes back,226,ZEV,"Yeah. I'm with you, Rouge Leader."
the empire strikes back,227,LUKE,We'll set harpoon. I'll cover for you.
the empire strikes back,228,ZEV,Coming around.
the empire strikes back,229,LUKE,"Watch that cross fire, boys."
the empire strikes back,230,ZEV,Set for position three.  Steady.
the empire strikes back,231,LUKE,Stay tight and low.
the empire strikes back,232,LUKE,"Hobbie, I've been hit!"
the empire strikes back,233,HAN,You all right?
the empire strikes back,234,LEIA,Why are you still here?
the empire strikes back,235,HAN,I heard the command center had been hit.
the empire strikes back,236,LEIA,You got your clearance to leave.
the empire strikes back,237,HAN,Don't worry. I'll leave. First I'm going to get you to your ship.
the empire strikes back,238,THREEPIO,"Your Highness, we must take this last transport. It's our  only hope."
the empire strikes back,239,LEIA,Send all troops in sector twelve to the south  slope to protect the fighters.
the empire strikes back,240,ANNOUNCER,Imperial troops have entered the base.
the empire strikes back,241,HAN,Come on...that's it.
the empire strikes back,242,LEIA,Give the evacuation code signal. And get to  your transports!
the empire strikes back,243,HEAD CONTROLLER,K-one-zero...all troops disengage.
the empire strikes back,244,THREEPIO,Oh! Wait for me!
the empire strikes back,245,OFFICER,Begin retreat!
the empire strikes back,246,SECOND OFFICER,Fall back!
the empire strikes back,247,VEERS,Distance to power generators?
the empire strikes back,248,PILOT,"One-seven, decimal two-eight."
the empire strikes back,249,VEERS,Target. Maximum fire power.
the empire strikes back,250,HAN,"Transport, this is Solo. Better take off -- I  can't get to you. I'll get the princess out on the Falcon."
the empire strikes back,251,THREEPIO,But...but...but...where are you going? Uh...come back!!
the empire strikes back,252,THREEPIO,Wait! Wait for me! Wait! Stop!
the empire strikes back,253,THREEPIO,How typical.
the empire strikes back,254,HAN,Come on.
the empire strikes back,255,HAN,"Hurry up, goldenrod, or you're going to be a permanent resident!"
the empire strikes back,256,THREEPIO,Wait! Wait!
the empire strikes back,257,HAN,How's this?
the empire strikes back,258,LEIA,Would it helped if I got out and pushed?
the empire strikes back,259,HAN,It might.
the empire strikes back,260,THREEPIO,"Captain Solo, Captain Solo...sir, might I suggest that  you..."
the empire strikes back,261,THREEPIO,It can wait.
the empire strikes back,262,LEIA,The bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade.
the empire strikes back,263,HAN,"This baby's got a few surprises left in her, sweetheart."
the empire strikes back,264,HAN,Come on! Come on! Switch over. Let's hope we don't have a  burnout.
the empire strikes back,265,HAN,See?
the empire strikes back,266,LEIA,"Someday you're going to be wrong, and I hope I'm there to see it."
the empire strikes back,267,HAN,Punch it!
the empire strikes back,268,LUKE,Artoo! Get her ready for takeoff.
the empire strikes back,269,WEDGE,"Good luck, Luke. See you at the rendezvous."
the empire strikes back,270,LUKE,"Don't worry, Artoo. We're going, we're going."
the empire strikes back,271,LUKE,"There's nothing wrong, Artoo. I'm just setting a  new course."
the empire strikes back,272,LUKE,We're not going to regroup with the others.
the empire strikes back,273,LUKE,We're going to the Dagobah system.
the empire strikes back,274,LUKE,"Yes, Artoo?"
the empire strikes back,275,LUKE,That's all right. I'd like to keep it  on manual control for a while.
the empire strikes back,276,HAN,I saw them! I saw them!
the empire strikes back,277,LEIA,Saw what?
the empire strikes back,278,HAN,"Star Destroyers, two of them, coming right at us."
the empire strikes back,279,THREEPIO,"Sir, sir! Might I suggest..."
the empire strikes back,280,HAN,Shut him up or shut him down!  Check the  deflector shield!
the empire strikes back,281,HAN,"Oh, great. Well, we can still outmaneuver them."
the empire strikes back,282,IMPERIAL OFFICER,Take evasive action!
the empire strikes back,283,HAN,Prepare to make the jump to light-speed.
the empire strikes back,284,THREEPIO,"But, sir!"
the empire strikes back,285,LEIA,They're getting closer!
the empire strikes back,286,HAN,Oh yeah? Watch this.
the empire strikes back,287,LEIA,Watch what?
the empire strikes back,288,HAN,I think we're in trouble.
the empire strikes back,289,THREEPIO,"If I may say so, sir, I noticed earlier the hyperdrive  motivator has been damaged. It's impossible to go to light-speed!"
the empire strikes back,290,HAN,We're in trouble!
the empire strikes back,291,HAN,Horizontal boosters...!
the empire strikes back,292,HAN,Alluvial dampers...! Well that's not it.
the empire strikes back,293,HAN,Bring me the hydrospanners!
the empire strikes back,294,HAN,I don't know how we're going to get out of this one.
the empire strikes back,295,HAN,Oww! Chewie!
the empire strikes back,296,HAN,That was no laser blast! Something hit us.
the empire strikes back,297,LEIA,"Han, get up here!"
the empire strikes back,298,HAN,"Come on, Chewie!"
the empire strikes back,299,LEIA,Asteroids!
the empire strikes back,300,HAN,"Oh, no! Chewie, set two-seven-one."
the empire strikes back,301,LEIA,What are you doing? You're not actually going into an asteroid  field?
the empire strikes back,302,HAN,"They'd be crazy to follow us, wouldn't they?"
the empire strikes back,303,LEIA,You don't have to do this to impress me.
the empire strikes back,304,THREEPIO,"Sir, the possibility of successfully navigating an asteroid  field is approximately three thousand, seven hundred and twenty to one."
the empire strikes back,305,HAN,Never tell me the odds!
the empire strikes back,306,HAN,"You said you wanted to be around when I made a mistake; well,  this could be it, sweetheart."
the empire strikes back,307,LEIA,I take it back. We're going to get pulverized if we stay out  here much longer.
the empire strikes back,308,HAN,I'm not going to argue with that.
the empire strikes back,309,THREEPIO,Pulverized?
the empire strikes back,310,HAN,I'm going in closer to one of the big ones.
the empire strikes back,311,LEIA,Closer?
the empire strikes back,312,THREEPIO,Closer?!
the empire strikes back,313,THREEPIO,"Oh, this is suicide!"
the empire strikes back,314,HAN,There. That looks pretty good.
the empire strikes back,315,LEIA,What looks pretty good?
the empire strikes back,316,HAN,Yeah. That'll do nicely.
the empire strikes back,317,THREEPIO,"Excuse me, ma'am, but where are we going?"
the empire strikes back,318,LEIA,I hope you know what you're doing.
the empire strikes back,319,HAN,"Yeah, me too."
the empire strikes back,320,LUKE,"Yes, that's it. Dagobah."
the empire strikes back,321,LUKE,"No, I'm not going to change my mind about this.   I'm not picking up any cities or technology. Massive life-form readings, though. There's something alive down there..."
the empire strikes back,322,LUKE,"Yes, I'm sure it's perfectly safe for droids."
the empire strikes back,323,LUKE,"I know, I know! All the scopes are dead. I can't  see a thing! Just hang on, I'm going to start the landing cycle..."
the empire strikes back,324,LUKE,"No, Artoo, you stay put. I'll have a look around."
the empire strikes back,325,LUKE,Artoo?
the empire strikes back,326,LUKE,Artoo! Where are you?
the empire strikes back,327,LUKE,Artoo! You be more careful.
the empire strikes back,328,LUKE,Artoo -- that way!
the empire strikes back,329,LUKE,Artoo!
the empire strikes back,330,LUKE,"Oh, no! Are you all right? Come on. You're lucky you don't taste  very good. Anything broken?"
the empire strikes back,331,LUKE,"If you're saying coming here was a bad idea, I'm beginning to  agree with you. Oh, Artoo, what are we doing here? It's like... something out of a dream, or, I don't know. Maybe I'm just going crazy."
the empire strikes back,332,VADER,"Yes, Admiral?"
the empire strikes back,333,PIETT,"Our ships have sighted the Millennium Falcon, lord. But...it  has entered an asteroid field and we cannot risk..."
the empire strikes back,334,VADER,"Asteroids do not concern me, Admiral. I want  that ship and not excuses."
the empire strikes back,335,PIETT,"Yes, lord."
the empire strikes back,336,HAN,I'm going to shut down everything but the emergency power  systems.
the empire strikes back,337,THREEPIO,"Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but...does that include  shutting me down, too?"
the empire strikes back,338,HAN,"No, I need you to talk to the Falcon, find out what's wrong with  the hyperdrive."
the empire strikes back,339,THREEPIO,"Sir, it's quite possible this asteroid is not entirely  stable."
the empire strikes back,340,HAN,"Not entirely stable? I'm glad you're here to tell us these  things.  Chewie, take the professor in the back and plug him into the hyperdrive."
the empire strikes back,341,THREEPIO,"Oh! Sometimes I just don't understand human behavior. After  all, I'm only trying to do my job in the most..."
the empire strikes back,342,LEIA,Let go.
the empire strikes back,343,HAN,Sshh!
the empire strikes back,344,LEIA,"Let go, please."
the empire strikes back,345,HAN,Don't get excited.
the empire strikes back,346,LEIA,"Captain, being held by you isn't quite enough to get me excited."
the empire strikes back,347,HAN,"Sorry, sweetheart. We haven't got time for anything else."
the empire strikes back,348,LUKE,Ready for some power? Okay. Let's see now. Put that in there.  There you go.
the empire strikes back,349,LUKE,Now all I have to do is find this Yoda...if he even  exists.
the empire strikes back,350,LUKE,Still...there's something familiar about this place. I feel  like...I don't know...
the empire strikes back,351,STRANGE VOICE,Feel like what?
the empire strikes back,352,LUKE,Like we're being watched!
the empire strikes back,353,CREATURE,Away with your weapon! I mean you no harm.
the empire strikes back,354,CREATURE,"I am wondering, why are you here?"
the empire strikes back,355,LUKE,I'm looking for someone.
the empire strikes back,356,CREATURE,"Looking? Found someone, you have, I would say, hmmm?"
the empire strikes back,357,LUKE,Right.
the empire strikes back,358,CREATURE,"Help you I can. Yes, mmmm."
the empire strikes back,359,LUKE,I don't think so. I'm looking for a great warrior.
the empire strikes back,360,CREATURE,Ahhh! A great warrior.  Wars not  make one great.
the empire strikes back,361,LUKE,Put that down. Hey! That's my dinner.
the empire strikes back,362,CREATURE,"How you get so big, eating food of this kind?"
the empire strikes back,363,LUKE,"Listen, friend, we didn't mean to land in that puddle, and if we  could get our ship out, we would, but we can't, so why don't you just..."
the empire strikes back,364,CREATURE,"Aww, cannot get your ship out?"
the empire strikes back,365,LUKE,"Hey, you could have broken this. Don't do that. Ohhh...you're  making a mess. Hey, give me that!"
the empire strikes back,366,CREATURE,Mine! Or I will help you not.
the empire strikes back,367,LUKE,I don't want your help. I want my lamp back. I'll need it to get  out of this slimy mudhole.
the empire strikes back,368,CREATURE,Mudhole? Slimy? My home this is.
the empire strikes back,369,CREATURE,"Ah, ah, ah!"
the empire strikes back,370,LUKE,"Oh, Artoo, let him have it."
the empire strikes back,371,CREATURE,Mine! Mine!
the empire strikes back,372,LUKE,Artoo!
the empire strikes back,373,CREATURE,Mine!
the empire strikes back,374,CREATURE,Mine!
the empire strikes back,375,LUKE,"Now will you move along, little fella? We're got a lot  of work to do."
the empire strikes back,376,CREATURE,"No! No, no! Stay and help you, I will.  Find your  friend, hmm?"
the empire strikes back,377,LUKE,"I'm not looking for a friend, I'm looking for a Jedi Master."
the empire strikes back,378,CREATURE,Oohhh. Jedi Master. Yoda. You seek Yoda.
the empire strikes back,379,LUKE,You know him?
the empire strikes back,380,CREATURE,"Mmm. Take you to him, I will.  Yes, yes. But now, we  must eat. Come. Good food. Come."
the empire strikes back,381,CREATURE,"Come, come."
the empire strikes back,382,LUKE,"Stay here and watch after the camp, Artoo."
the empire strikes back,383,THREEPIO,"Oh, where is Artoo when I need him?"
the empire strikes back,384,THREEPIO,"Sir, I don't know where your ship learned to communicate,  but it has the most peculiar dialect. I believe, sir, it says that the power coupling on the negative axis has been polarized. I'm afraid you'll have to replace it."
the empire strikes back,385,HAN,"Well, of course I'll have to replace it."
the empire strikes back,386,HAN,Here! And Chewie...
the empire strikes back,387,HAN,...I think we'd better replace the negative power  coupling.
the empire strikes back,388,HAN,"Hey, Your Worship, I'm only trying to help."
the empire strikes back,389,LEIA,Would you please stop calling me that?
the empire strikes back,390,HAN,"Sure, Leia."
the empire strikes back,391,LEIA,"Oh, you make it so difficult sometimes."
the empire strikes back,392,HAN,"I do, I really do. You could be a little nicer, though.  Come on, admit it. Sometimes you think I'm all right."
the empire strikes back,393,LEIA,Occasionally  maybe...when you aren't  acting like a scoundrel.
the empire strikes back,394,HAN,Scoundrel? Scoundrel? I like the sound of that.
the empire strikes back,395,LEIA,Stop that.
the empire strikes back,396,HAN,Stop what?
the empire strikes back,397,LEIA,Stop that! My hands are dirty.
the empire strikes back,398,HAN,"My hands are dirty, too. What are you afraid of?"
the empire strikes back,399,LEIA,Afraid?
the empire strikes back,400,HAN,You're trembling.
the empire strikes back,401,LEIA,I'm not trembling.
the empire strikes back,402,HAN,You like me because I'm a scoundrel. There aren't enough  scoundrels in your life.
the empire strikes back,403,LEIA,I happen to like nice men.
the empire strikes back,404,HAN,I'm a nice man.
the empire strikes back,405,LEIA,"No, you're not. You're..."
the empire strikes back,406,THREEPIO,"Sir, sir! I've isolated the reverse power flux coupling."
the empire strikes back,407,HAN,Thank you. Thank you very much.
the empire strikes back,408,THREEPIO,"Oh, you're perfectly welcome, sir."
the empire strikes back,409,NEEDA,"...and that, Lord Vader, was the last time they  appeared in any of our scopes. Considering the amount of damage we've sustained, they must have been destroyed."
the empire strikes back,410,VADER,"No, Captain, they're alive. I want every ship available to  sweep the asteroid field until they are found."
the empire strikes back,411,PIETT,Lord Vader.
the empire strikes back,412,VADER,"Yes, Admiral, what is it?"
the empire strikes back,413,PIETT,The Emperor commands you make contact with him.
the empire strikes back,414,VADER,Move the ship out of the asteroid field so that we can send a  clear transmission.
the empire strikes back,415,PIETT,"Yes, my lord."
the empire strikes back,416,VADER,"What is thy bidding, my master?"
the empire strikes back,417,EMPEROR,There is a great disturbance in the Force.
the empire strikes back,418,VADER,I have felt it.
the empire strikes back,419,EMPEROR,We have a new enemy -- Luke Skywalker.
the empire strikes back,420,VADER,"Yes, my master."
the empire strikes back,421,EMPEROR,He could destroy us.
the empire strikes back,422,VADER,He's just a boy. Obi-Wan can no longer help him.
the empire strikes back,423,EMPEROR,The Force is strong with him. The son of Skywalker must not  become a Jedi.
the empire strikes back,424,VADER,"If he could be turned, he would become a powerful ally."
the empire strikes back,425,EMPEROR,Yes. Yes. He would be a great asset. Can it be done?
the empire strikes back,426,VADER,"He will join us or die, my master."
the empire strikes back,427,LUKE,"Look, I'm sure it's delicious. I just don't understand why we  can't see Yoda now."
the empire strikes back,428,CREATURE,"Patience! For the Jedi it is time to eat as well. Eat, eat.  Hot. Good food, hm? Good, hmm?"
the empire strikes back,429,LUKE,How far away is Yoda? Will it take us long to get there?
the empire strikes back,430,CREATURE,"Not far. Yoda not far. Patience. Soon you will be with him.   Rootleaf, I cook. Why wish you become Jedi? Hm?"
the empire strikes back,431,LUKE,"Mostly because of my father, I guess."
the empire strikes back,432,CREATURE,"Ah, your father. Powerful Jedi was he, powerful Jedi, mmm."
the empire strikes back,433,LUKE,"Oh, come on. How could you know my father? You  don't even know who I am.  Oh, I don't even know what I'm doing here. We're wasting our time."
the empire strikes back,434,CREATURE,I cannot teach him. The boy has no patience.
the empire strikes back,435,BEN,He will learn patience.
the empire strikes back,436,YODA,"Hmmm. Much anger in him, like his father."
the empire strikes back,437,BEN,Was I any different when you taught me?
the empire strikes back,438,YODA,Hah. He is not ready.
the empire strikes back,439,LUKE,"Yoda! I am ready. I...Ben! I can be a Jedi. Ben, tell him I'm  ready."
the empire strikes back,440,YODA,"Ready, are you? What know you of ready? For eight hundred years  have I trained Jedi. My own counsel will I keep on who is to be trained! A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind.  This one a long time have I watched. Never his mind on where he was. Hmm? What he was doing. Hmph. Adventure. Heh! Excitement. Heh! A Jedi craves not these things.  You are reckless!"
the empire strikes back,441,BEN,"So was I, if you'll remember."
the empire strikes back,442,YODA,"He is too old. Yes, too old to begin the training."
the empire strikes back,443,LUKE,But I've learned so much.
the empire strikes back,444,YODA,Will he finished what he begins?
the empire strikes back,445,LUKE,I won't fail you -- I'm not afraid.
the empire strikes back,446,YODA,"Oh, you will be. You will be."
the empire strikes back,447,THREEPIO,"Sir, if I may venture an opinion..."
the empire strikes back,448,HAN,"I'm not really interested in your opinion, Threepio."
the empire strikes back,449,LEIA,There's something out there.
the empire strikes back,450,HAN,Where?
the empire strikes back,451,LEIA,"Outside, in the cave."
the empire strikes back,452,THREEPIO,There it is. Listen! Listen!
the empire strikes back,453,HAN,I'm going out there.
the empire strikes back,454,LEIA,Are you crazy?!
the empire strikes back,455,HAN,I just got this bucket back together. I'm not going to let  something tear it apart.
the empire strikes back,456,LEIA,Then I'm going with you.
the empire strikes back,457,THREEPIO,"I think it might be better if I stay here and guard the  ship.  Oh, no."
the empire strikes back,458,LEIA,This ground sure feels strange. It doesn't feel like rock at  all.
the empire strikes back,459,HAN,There's an awful lot of moisture in here.
the empire strikes back,460,LEIA,I don't know. I have a bad feeling about this.
the empire strikes back,461,HAN,Yeah.
the empire strikes back,462,HAN,Watch out!
the empire strikes back,463,HAN,"Yeah, that's what I thought. Mynock. Chewie, check the rest of  the ship, make sure there aren't any more attached. They're chewing on the power cables."
the empire strikes back,464,LEIA,Mynocks?
the empire strikes back,465,HAN,Go on inside. We'll clean them off if there are any more.
the empire strikes back,466,THREEPIO,Ohhh! Go away! Go away! Beastly thing. Shoo! Shoo!
the empire strikes back,467,HAN,Wait a minute...
the empire strikes back,468,HAN,"All right, Chewie, let's get out of here!"
the empire strikes back,469,LEIA,The Empire is still out there. I don't think it's wise to...
the empire strikes back,470,HAN,No time to discuss this as a committee.
the empire strikes back,471,LEIA,I am not a committee!
the empire strikes back,472,LEIA,You can't make the jump to light-speed in this asteroid field...
the empire strikes back,473,HAN,"Sit down, sweetheart. We're taking off!"
the empire strikes back,474,THREEPIO,Look!
the empire strikes back,475,HAN,"I see it, I see it."
the empire strikes back,476,THREEPIO,We're doomed!
the empire strikes back,477,LEIA,The cave is collapsing.
the empire strikes back,478,HAN,This is no cave.
the empire strikes back,479,LEIA,What?
the empire strikes back,480,YODA,"Run! Yes. A Jedi's strength flows from the Force. But beware of  the dark side. Anger...fear...aggression. The dark side of the Force are they. Easily they flow, quick to join you in a fight. If once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny, consume you it will, as it did Obi-Wan's apprentice."
the empire strikes back,481,LUKE,Vader. Is the dark side stronger?
the empire strikes back,482,YODA,"No...no...no. Quicker, easier, more seductive."
the empire strikes back,483,LUKE,But how am I to know the good side from the bad?
the empire strikes back,484,YODA,"You will know. When you are calm, at peace. Passive. A Jedi uses  the Force for knowledge and defense, never for attack."
the empire strikes back,485,LUKE,But tell me why I can't...
the empire strikes back,486,YODA,"No, no, there is no why. Nothing more will I  teach you today. Clear your mind of questions. Mmm. Mmmmmm."
the empire strikes back,487,LUKE,There's something not right here.
the empire strikes back,488,LUKE,"I feel cold, death."
the empire strikes back,489,YODA,That place...is strong with the dark side of the Force. A domain  of evil it is. In you must go.
the empire strikes back,490,LUKE,What's in there?
the empire strikes back,491,YODA,Only what you take with you.
the empire strikes back,492,YODA,Your weapons...you will not need them.
the empire strikes back,493,PIETT,Bounty hunters. We don't need that scum.
the empire strikes back,494,FIRST CONTROLLER,"Yes, sir."
the empire strikes back,495,PIETT,Those Rebels won't escape us.
the empire strikes back,496,SECOND CONTROLLER,"Sir, we have a priority signal from the Star  Destroyer Avenger."
the empire strikes back,497,PIETT,Right.
the empire strikes back,498,VADER,"...there will be a substantial reward for the one who finds  the Millennium Falcon. You are free to use any methods necessary, but I want them alive. No disintegrations."
the empire strikes back,499,BOBA FETT,As you wish.
the empire strikes back,500,PIETT,"Lord Vader! My lord, we have them."
the empire strikes back,501,THREEPIO,"Oh, thank goodness we're coming out of the asteroid field."
the empire strikes back,502,HAN,Let's get out of here. Ready for light-speed? One...two...three!
the empire strikes back,503,HAN,It's not fair!
the empire strikes back,504,HAN,The transfer circuits are working. It's not my fault!
the empire strikes back,505,LEIA,No light-speed?
the empire strikes back,506,HAN,It's not my fault.
the empire strikes back,507,THREEPIO,"Sir, we just lost the main rear deflector shield. One more  direct hit on the back quarter and we're done for."
the empire strikes back,508,HAN,Turn her around.
the empire strikes back,509,HAN,I said turn her around! I'm going to put all power in the front  shield.
the empire strikes back,510,LEIA,You're going to attack them?!
the empire strikes back,511,THREEPIO,"Sir, the odds of surviving a direct assault on an Imperial  Star Destroyer..."
the empire strikes back,512,LEIA,Shut up!
the empire strikes back,513,NEEDA,They're moving to attack position. Shields up!
the empire strikes back,514,NEEDA,"Track them,. They may come around for another pass."
the empire strikes back,515,TRACKING OFFICER,"Captain Needa, the ship no longer appears on our  scopes."
the empire strikes back,516,NEEDA,They can't have disappeared. No ship that small has a cloaking  device.
the empire strikes back,517,TRACKING OFFICER,"Well, there's no trace of them, sir."
the empire strikes back,518,COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER,"Captain, Lord Vader demands an update on the  pursuit."
the empire strikes back,519,NEEDA,"Get a shuttle ready. I shall assume full  responsibility for losing them, and apologize to Lord Vader. Meanwhile, continue to scan the area."
the empire strikes back,520,COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER,"Yes, Captain Needa."
the empire strikes back,521,YODA,Use the Force. Yes...
the empire strikes back,522,YODA,Now...the stone. Feel it.
the empire strikes back,523,YODA,Concentrate!
the empire strikes back,524,LUKE,"Oh, no. We'll never get it out now."
the empire strikes back,525,YODA,So certain are you. Always with you it cannot be done. Hear you  nothing that I say?
the empire strikes back,526,LUKE,"Master, moving stones around is one thing. This is totally  different."
the empire strikes back,527,YODA,No! No different! Only different in your mind. You must unlearn  what you have learned.
the empire strikes back,528,LUKE,"All right, I'll give it a try."
the empire strikes back,529,YODA,No! Try not. Do. Or do not. There is no try.
the empire strikes back,530,LUKE,I can't. It's too big.
the empire strikes back,531,YODA,"Size matters not. Look at me. Judge me by my size, do you? Hm?  Mmmm."
the empire strikes back,532,YODA,"And well you should not. For my ally in the Force. And a  powerful ally it is. Life creates it, makes it grow. It's energy surrounds us and binds us. Luminous beings are we......not this crude matter.  You must feel the Force around you.  Here, between you...me...the tree...the rock...everywhere! Yes, even between this land and that ship!"
the empire strikes back,533,LUKE,You want the impossible.
the empire strikes back,534,LUKE,I don't...I don't believe it.
the empire strikes back,535,YODA,That is why you fail.
the empire strikes back,536,VADER,"Apology accepted, Captain Needa."
the empire strikes back,537,PIETT,"Lord Vader, our ships have completed their scan of the area and  found nothing. If the Millennium Falcon went into light-speed, it'll be on the other side of the galaxy by now."
the empire strikes back,538,VADER,Alert all commands. Calculate every possible destination along  their last know trajectory.
the empire strikes back,539,PIETT,"Yes, my lord. We'll find them."
the empire strikes back,540,VADER,"Don't fail me again, Admiral."
the empire strikes back,541,PIETT,Alert all commands. Deploy the fleet.
the empire strikes back,542,THREEPIO,"Captain Solo, this time you have gone too far.  No, I will not be quiet, Chewbacca. Why doesn't anyone listen to me?"
the empire strikes back,543,HAN,The fleet is beginning to break up. Go back and stand  by the manual release for the landing claw.
the empire strikes back,544,THREEPIO,I really don't see how thats going to help. Surrender is a  perfectly acceptable alternative in extreme circumstances. The Empire may be gracious enough...
the empire strikes back,545,HAN,Thank you.
the empire strikes back,546,LEIA,What did you have in mind for your next move?
the empire strikes back,547,HAN,"Well, if they follow standard Imperial procedure, they'll dump  their garbage before they go to light-speed, then we just float away."
the empire strikes back,548,LEIA,With the rest of the garbage. Then what?
the empire strikes back,549,HAN,Then we've got to find a safe port somewhere around here. Got any  ideas?
the empire strikes back,550,LEIA,No. Where are we?
the empire strikes back,551,HAN,The Anoat system.
the empire strikes back,552,LEIA,Anoat system. There's not much there.
the empire strikes back,553,HAN,"No. Well, wait. This is interesting. Lando."
the empire strikes back,554,LEIA,Lando system?
the empire strikes back,555,HAN,"Lando's not a system, he's a man. Lando Calrissian. He's a card  player, gambler, scoundrel. You'd like him."
the empire strikes back,556,LEIA,Thanks.
the empire strikes back,557,HAN,"Bespin. It's pretty far, but I think we can make it."
the empire strikes back,558,LEIA,A mining colony?
the empire strikes back,559,HAN,"Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine. Lando conned somebody out of it. We go  back a long way, Lando and me."
the empire strikes back,560,LEIA,Can you trust him?
the empire strikes back,561,HAN,"No. But he has no love for the Empire, I can tell you that."
the empire strikes back,562,HAN,"Here we go, Chewie. Stand by. Detach!"
the empire strikes back,563,LEIA,"You do have your moments. Not many, but you have them."
the empire strikes back,564,YODA,"Concentrate...feel the Force flow. Yes. Good. Calm, yes. Through  the Force, things you will see. Other places. The future...the past. Old friends long gone."
the empire strikes back,565,LUKE,Han! Leia!
the empire strikes back,566,YODA,"Hmm. Control, control. You must learn control."
the empire strikes back,567,LUKE,I saw...I saw a city in the clouds.
the empire strikes back,568,YODA,Mmm. Friends you have there.
the empire strikes back,569,LUKE,They were in pain.
the empire strikes back,570,YODA,It is the future you see.
the empire strikes back,571,LUKE,Future? Will they die?
the empire strikes back,572,YODA,Difficult to see. Always in motion is the future.
the empire strikes back,573,LUKE,I've got to go to them.
the empire strikes back,574,YODA,"Decide you must how to serve them best. If you leave now, help  them you could. But you would destroy all for which they have fought and suffered."
the empire strikes back,575,HAN,"No, I don't have a landing permit. I'm trying  to reach Lando Calrissian."
the empire strikes back,576,HAN,Whoa! Wait a minute! Let me explain.
the empire strikes back,577,INTERCOM VOICE,You will not deviate from your present course.
the empire strikes back,578,THREEPIO,"Rather touchy, aren't they?"
the empire strikes back,579,LEIA,I thought you knew this person.
the empire strikes back,580,HAN,"Well, that was a long time ago. I'm sure he's  forgotten about that."
the empire strikes back,581,INTERCOM VOICE,Permission granted to land on Platform  Three-two-seven.
the empire strikes back,582,HAN,Thank you.
the empire strikes back,583,HAN,"There's nothing to worry about. We go way back, Lando and me."
the empire strikes back,584,LEIA,Who's worried?
the empire strikes back,585,THREEPIO,Oh. No one to meet us.
the empire strikes back,586,LEIA,I don't like this.
the empire strikes back,587,HAN,"Well, what would you like?"
the empire strikes back,588,THREEPIO,"Well, they did let us land."
the empire strikes back,589,HAN,"Look, don't worry. Everything's going to be fine. Trust me."
the empire strikes back,590,HAN,"See? My friend.  Keep your eyes open, okay?"
the empire strikes back,591,LANDO,"Why, you slimy, double-crossing, no-good swindler! You've got a  lot of guts coming here, after what you pulled."
the empire strikes back,592,LANDO,"How you doing, you old pirate? So good to see you! I  never thought I'd catch up with you again. Where you been?"
the empire strikes back,593,THREEPIO,"Well, he seems very friendly."
the empire strikes back,594,LEIA,Yes...very friendly.
the empire strikes back,595,LANDO,What are you doing here?
the empire strikes back,596,HAN,Ahh...repairs. I thought you could  help me out.
the empire strikes back,597,LANDO,What have you done to my ship?
the empire strikes back,598,HAN,"Your ship? Hey, remember, you lost her to me fair and square."
the empire strikes back,599,LANDO,Hello. What have we here? Welcome. I'm Lando Calrissian. I'm  the administrator of this facility. and who might you be?
the empire strikes back,600,LEIA,Leia.
the empire strikes back,601,LANDO,"Welcome, Leia."
the empire strikes back,602,HAN,"All right, all right, you old smoothie."
the empire strikes back,603,THREEPIO,"Hello, sir. I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations. My  facilities are at your..."
the empire strikes back,604,THREEPIO,"Well, really!"
the empire strikes back,605,LANDO,What's wrong with the Falcon?
the empire strikes back,606,HAN,Hyperdrive.
the empire strikes back,607,LANDO,I'll get my people to work on it.
the empire strikes back,608,HAN,Good.
the empire strikes back,609,LANDO,"You know, that ship saved my life quite a few times. She's the  fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy."
the empire strikes back,610,HAN,How's the gas mine? Is it paying off for you?
the empire strikes back,611,LANDO,"Oh, not as well as I'd like. We're a small outpost and not very  self-sufficient. And I've had supply problems of every kind. I've had labor difficulties... What's so funny?"
the empire strikes back,612,HAN,"You. Listen to you -- you sound like a businessman, a responsible  leader. Who'd have thought that, huh?"
the empire strikes back,613,LANDO,"You know, seeing you sure brings back a few things."
the empire strikes back,614,HAN,Yeah.
the empire strikes back,615,LANDO,"Yeah, I'm responsible these days. It's the  price you pay for being successful."
the empire strikes back,616,THREEPIO,Oh! Nice to see a familiar face.
the empire strikes back,617,SECOND THREEPIO,E chu ta!
the empire strikes back,618,THREEPIO,How rude!
the empire strikes back,619,THREEPIO,That sounds like an R2 unit in there. I wonder if...
the empire strikes back,620,THREEPIO,"Hello? How interesting. Oh, my."
the empire strikes back,621,MAN,Who are you?
the empire strikes back,622,THREEPIO,"Oh, I'm terribly sorry. I...I didn't mean to intrude. No,  no, please don't get up. No!"
the empire strikes back,623,YODA,Luke! You must complete the training.
the empire strikes back,624,LUKE,I can't keep the vision out of my head. They're my friends. I've  got to help them.
the empire strikes back,625,YODA,You must not go!
the empire strikes back,626,LUKE,But Han and Leia will die if I don't.
the empire strikes back,627,BEN,You don't know that.
the empire strikes back,628,BEN,Even Yoda cannot see their fate.
the empire strikes back,629,LUKE,But I can help them! I feel the Force!
the empire strikes back,630,BEN,"But you cannot control it. This is a dangerous time for you, when  you will be tempted by the dark side of the Force."
the empire strikes back,631,YODA,"Yes, yes. To Obi-Wan you listen. The cave. Remember your failure  at the cave!"
the empire strikes back,632,LUKE,"But I've learned so much since then. Master Yoda, I promise to  return and finish what I've begun. You have my word."
the empire strikes back,633,BEN,It is you and your abilities the Emperor wants. that is why your  friends are made to suffer.
the empire strikes back,634,LUKE,And that is why I have to go.
the empire strikes back,635,BEN,"Luke, I don't want to lose you to the Emperor the way I lost  Vader."
the empire strikes back,636,LUKE,You won't.
the empire strikes back,637,YODA,"Stopped they must be. On this depends. Only a fully trained Jedi  Knight with the Force as his ally will conquer Vader and his Emperor. If you end your training now, if you choose the quick and easy path, as Vader did, you will become an agent of evil."
the empire strikes back,638,BEN,Patience.
the empire strikes back,639,LUKE,And sacrifice Han and Leia?
the empire strikes back,640,YODA,If you honor what they fight for...yes!
the empire strikes back,641,BEN,"If you choose to face Vader, you will do it alone. I cannot  interfere."
the empire strikes back,642,LUKE,"I understand.  Artoo, fire up the  converters."
the empire strikes back,643,BEN,"Luke, don't give in to hate -- that leads to the dark side."
the empire strikes back,644,YODA,Strong is Vader. Mind what you have learned. Save you it can.
the empire strikes back,645,LUKE,I will. And I'll return. I promise.
the empire strikes back,646,YODA,"Told you, I did. Reckless is he. Now matters are worse."
the empire strikes back,647,BEN,That boy is our last hope.
the empire strikes back,648,YODA,No. There is another.
the empire strikes back,649,HAN,The ship is almost finished. Two or Three more things and we're  in great shape.
the empire strikes back,650,LEIA,The sooner the better. Something's wrong here. No one has seen  or knows anything about Threepio. He's been gone too long to have gotten lost.
the empire strikes back,651,HAN,Relax. I'll talk to Lando and see what I can find out.
the empire strikes back,652,LEIA,I don't trust Lando.
the empire strikes back,653,HAN,"Well, I don't trust him, either. But he is my friend. Besides,  we'll soon be gone."
the empire strikes back,654,LEIA,"And then you're as good as gone, aren't you?"
the empire strikes back,655,LEIA,What happened?
the empire strikes back,656,HAN,Where? Found him in a junk pile?
the empire strikes back,657,LEIA,"Oh, what a mess. Chewie, do you think you can repair him?"
the empire strikes back,658,HAN,Lando's got people who can fix him.
the empire strikes back,659,LEIA,"No, thanks."
the empire strikes back,660,LANDO,I'm sorry. Am I interrupting anything?
the empire strikes back,661,LEIA,Not really.
the empire strikes back,662,LANDO,You look absolutely beautiful. You truly belong here with us  among the clouds.
the empire strikes back,663,LEIA,Thank you.
the empire strikes back,664,LANDO,Will you join me for a little refreshment?
the empire strikes back,665,LANDO,"Everyone's invited, of course."
the empire strikes back,666,LANDO,Having trouble with you droid?
the empire strikes back,667,HAN,No. No problem. Why?
the empire strikes back,668,LANDO,"So you see, since we're a small operation, we don't fall into  the...uh...jurisdiction of the Empire."
the empire strikes back,669,LEIA,So you're part of the mining guild then?
the empire strikes back,670,LANDO,"No, not actually. Our operation is small enough not to be  noticed...which is advantageous for everybody since our customers are anxious to avoid attracting attention to themselves."
the empire strikes back,671,HAN,Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to find out about this  little operation and shut you down?
the empire strikes back,672,LANDO,That's always been a danger looming like a shadow over  everything we've built here. But things have developed that will insure security. I've just made a deal that will keep the Empire out of here forever.
the empire strikes back,673,VADER,We would be honored if you would join us.
the empire strikes back,674,LANDO,I had no choice. They arrived right before you did. I'm sorry.
the empire strikes back,675,HAN,"I'm sorry, too."
the empire strikes back,676,LUKE,"No, Threepio's with them."
the empire strikes back,677,LUKE,Just hang on. We're almost there.
the empire strikes back,678,THREEPIO,"Mmmm. Oh, my. Uh, I, uh -- Take this off! I, uh, don't mean  to intrude here. I, don't, no, no, no...Please don't get up. No!"
the empire strikes back,679,THREEPIO,"Stormtroopers? Here? We're in danger. I must tell the  others. Oh, no! I've been shot!"
the empire strikes back,680,LANDO,Lord Vader.
the empire strikes back,681,VADER,You may take Captain Solo to Jabba the Hut after I  have Skywalker.
the empire strikes back,682,BOBA FETT,He's no good to me dead.
the empire strikes back,683,VADER,He will not be permanently damaged.
the empire strikes back,684,LANDO,"Lord Vader, what about Leia and the Wookiee?"
the empire strikes back,685,VADER,They must never again leave this city.
the empire strikes back,686,LANDO,"That was never a condition of our agreement, nor was giving Han  to this bounty hunter!"
the empire strikes back,687,VADER,Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly.
the empire strikes back,688,LANDO,No.
the empire strikes back,689,VADER,Good. It would be unfortunate if I had to leave a garrison  here.
the empire strikes back,690,LANDO,This deal's getting worse all the time.
the empire strikes back,691,THREEPIO,"Oh, yes, that's very good. I like that. Oh! Something's not  right because now I can't see. Wait. Wait! Oh, my! what have you done? I'm backwards, you stupid furball. Only an overgrown mophead like you would be stupid enough..."
the empire strikes back,692,HAN,I feel terrible.
the empire strikes back,693,LEIA,Why are they doing this?
the empire strikes back,694,HAN,They never even asked me any questions.
the empire strikes back,695,LEIA,Lando.
the empire strikes back,696,HAN,"Get out of here, Lando!"
the empire strikes back,697,LANDO,Shut up and listen! Vader has agreed to turn Leia and Chewie  over to me.
the empire strikes back,698,HAN,Over to you?
the empire strikes back,699,LANDO,"They'll have to stay here, but at least they'll be safe."
the empire strikes back,700,LEIA,What about Han?
the empire strikes back,701,LANDO,Vader's giving him to the bounty hunter.
the empire strikes back,702,LEIA,Vader wants us all dead.
the empire strikes back,703,LANDO,He doesn't want you at all. He's after somebody called  Skywalker.
the empire strikes back,704,HAN,Luke?
the empire strikes back,705,LANDO,Lord Vader has set a trap for him.
the empire strikes back,706,LEIA,And we're the bait.
the empire strikes back,707,LANDO,"Well, he's on his way."
the empire strikes back,708,HAN,"Perfect. You fixed us all pretty good, didn't you?   My friend!"
the empire strikes back,709,LANDO,"Stop! I've done all I can do. I'm sorry I couldn't do better,  but I have my own problems."
the empire strikes back,710,HAN,"Yeah, you're a real hero."
the empire strikes back,711,LEIA,You certainly have a way with people.
the empire strikes back,712,VADER,"This facility is crude, but it should be adequate to freeze  Skywalker for his journey to the Emperor."
the empire strikes back,713,IMPERIAL SOLDIER,"Lord Vader, ship approaching. X-wing class."
the empire strikes back,714,VADER,Good. Monitor Skywalker and allow him to land.
the empire strikes back,715,LANDO,"Lord Vader, we only use this facility for carbon freezing. If  you put him in there, it might kill him."
the empire strikes back,716,VADER,I do not want the Emperor's prize damaged. We will test it...on  Captain Solo.
the empire strikes back,717,THREEPIO,"If only you had attached my legs, I wouldn't be in this  ridiculous position. Now, remember, Chewbacca, you have a responsibility to me, so don't do anything foolish."
the empire strikes back,718,HAN,What's going on...buddy?
the empire strikes back,719,LANDO,You're being put into carbon freeze.
the empire strikes back,720,BOBA FETT,What if he doesn't survive? He's worth a lot to me.
the empire strikes back,721,VADER,The Empire will compensate you if he dies. Put him in!
the empire strikes back,722,THREEPIO,"Oh, no! No, no, no! Stop, Chewbacca, stop...!"
the empire strikes back,723,HAN,"Stop, Chewie, stop! Do you hear me? Stop!"
the empire strikes back,724,THREEPIO,"Yes, stop, please! I'm not ready to die."
the empire strikes back,725,HAN,"Chewie! Chewie, this won't help me. Hey!"
the empire strikes back,726,HAN,Save your strength. There'll be another time. The princess -- you  have to take care of her. You hear me?
the empire strikes back,727,LEIA,I love you!
the empire strikes back,728,HAN,I know.
the empire strikes back,729,THREEPIO,"What...what's going on? Turn around, Chewbacca, I can't see.  Oh...they've encased him in carbonite. He should be quite well-protected -- if he survives the freezing process, that is."
the empire strikes back,730,VADER,"Well, Calrissian, did he survive?"
the empire strikes back,731,LANDO,"Yes, he's alive. And in perfect hibernation."
the empire strikes back,732,VADER,He's all yours bounty hunter. Reset the chamber for Skywalker.
the empire strikes back,733,IMPERIAL OFFICER,"Skywalker has just landed, my lord."
the empire strikes back,734,VADER,"Good. See to it that he finds his way here. Calrissian, take  the princess and the Wookiee to my ship."
the empire strikes back,735,LANDO,You said they'd be left in the city under my supervision.
the empire strikes back,736,VADER,I am altering the deal. Pray I don't alter it any further.
the empire strikes back,737,LEIA,"Luke! Luke, don't -- it's a trap! It's a trap!"
the empire strikes back,738,VADER,"The Force is with you, young Skywalker. But you are not a Jedi  yet."
the empire strikes back,739,LANDO,Well done. Hold them in the security tower -- and keep it  quiet. Move.
the empire strikes back,740,LEIA,What do you think you're doing?
the empire strikes back,741,LANDO,We're getting out of here.
the empire strikes back,742,THREEPIO,I knew all along it had to be a mistake.
the empire strikes back,743,LEIA,Do you think that after what you did to Han we're going to trust  you?
the empire strikes back,744,LANDO,I had no choice...
the empire strikes back,745,THREEPIO,"What are you doing? Trust him, trust him!"
the empire strikes back,746,LEIA,"Oh, so we understand, don't we, Chewie? He had no choice."
the empire strikes back,747,LANDO,I'm just trying to help...
the empire strikes back,748,LEIA,We don't need any of your help.
the empire strikes back,749,LANDO,H-a-a-a...
the empire strikes back,750,LEIA,What?
the empire strikes back,751,THREEPIO,It sounds like Han.
the empire strikes back,752,LANDO,"There's still a chance to save Han...I mean, at the East  Platform..."
the empire strikes back,753,LEIA,Chewie.
the empire strikes back,754,THREEPIO,"I'm terribly sorry about all this. After all,  he's only a Wookiee."
the empire strikes back,755,BOBA FETT,Put Captain Solo in the cargo hold.
the empire strikes back,756,THREEPIO,Artoo! Artoo! Where have you been?
the empire strikes back,757,THREEPIO,"Turn around, you wooly...!  Hurry, hurry! We're  trying to save Han from the bounty hunter!"
the empire strikes back,758,THREEPIO,"Well, at least your still in one piece! Look what happened  to me!"
the empire strikes back,759,THREEPIO,"Oh, no! Chewie, they're behind you!"
the empire strikes back,760,VADER,"You have learned much, young one."
the empire strikes back,761,LUKE,You'll find I'm full of surprises.
the empire strikes back,762,VADER,"Your destiny lies with me, Skywalker. Obi-Wan knew this to be  true."
the empire strikes back,763,LUKE,No!
the empire strikes back,764,VADER,All to easy. Perhaps you are not as strong as the Emperor  thought.
the empire strikes back,765,VADER,Impressive...most impressive.
the empire strikes back,766,VADER,Obi-Wan has taught you well. You have controlled your fear...  now release your anger.
the empire strikes back,767,VADER,Only your hatred can destroy me.
the empire strikes back,768,LANDO,The security codes has been changed!
the empire strikes back,769,THREEPIO,"Artoo, you can tell the computer to override the security  system."
the empire strikes back,770,LANDO,Attention! This is Lando Calrissian. The Empire has takes  control of the city. I advise everyone to leave before more Imperial troops arrive.
the empire strikes back,771,LANDO,This way.
the empire strikes back,772,THREEPIO,Don't blame me. I'm an interpreter. I'm not supposed to know  a power socket from a computer terminal.
the empire strikes back,773,THREEPIO,"What are you talking about? We're not interested in the  hyperdrive on the Millennium Falcon. It's fixed! Just open the door, you stupid lump."
the empire strikes back,774,THREEPIO,I never doubted you for a second. Wonderful!
the empire strikes back,775,THREEPIO,"Ouch! Oh! Ah! That hurt, Bend down, you thoughtless...Ow!"
the empire strikes back,776,LANDO,Leia! Go!
the empire strikes back,777,THREEPIO,"I thought that hairy beast would be the end of me. Of  course, I've looked better."
the empire strikes back,778,VADER,You are beaten. It is useless to resist. Don't let yourself be  destroyed as Obi-Wan did.
the empire strikes back,779,VADER,"There is no escape. Don't make me destroy you. You do not yet  realize your importance. You have only begun to discover you power. Join me and I will complete your training. With our combined strength, we can end this destructive conflict and bring order to the galaxy."
the empire strikes back,780,LUKE,I'll never join you!
the empire strikes back,781,VADER,If you only knew the power of the dark side. Obi-Wan never told  you what happened to your father.
the empire strikes back,782,LUKE,He told me enough! He told me you killed him.
the empire strikes back,783,VADER,No. I am your father.
the empire strikes back,784,LUKE,No. No. That's not true! That's impossible!
the empire strikes back,785,VADER,Search your feelings. You know it to be true.
the empire strikes back,786,LUKE,No! No! No!
the empire strikes back,787,VADER,"Luke. You can destroy the Emperor. He has foreseen this. It is  your destiny. Join me, and we can rule the galaxy as father and son. Come with me. It's the only way."
the empire strikes back,788,LUKE,"Ben...Ben, please!"
the empire strikes back,789,LUKE,Ben. Leia!
the empire strikes back,790,LUKE,Hear me! Leia!
the empire strikes back,791,LEIA,Luke...We've got to go back.
the empire strikes back,792,LANDO,What?
the empire strikes back,793,LEIA,I know where Luke is.
the empire strikes back,794,LANDO,But what about those fighter?
the empire strikes back,795,LEIA,"Chewie, just do it."
the empire strikes back,796,LANDO,But what about Vader?
the empire strikes back,797,LANDO,"All right, all right, all right."
the empire strikes back,798,VADER,Bring my shuttle.
the empire strikes back,799,LANDO,"Look, someone's up there."
the empire strikes back,800,LEIA,"It's Luke. Chewie, slow down. Slow down and we'll get under him.  Lando, open the top hatch."
the empire strikes back,801,LEIA,"Okay. Easy, Chewie."
the empire strikes back,802,LEIA,Lando?
the empire strikes back,803,LANDO,"Okay, let's go."
the empire strikes back,804,LUKE,"Oh, Leia."
the empire strikes back,805,LANDO,"All right, Chewie. Let's go."
the empire strikes back,806,LEIA,I'll be back.
the empire strikes back,807,LEIA,Star Destroyer.
the empire strikes back,808,LANDO,"All right, Chewie. Ready for light-speed."
the empire strikes back,809,LEIA,If your people fixed the hyperdrive.
the empire strikes back,810,LEIA,All the coordinates are set. It's now or never.
the empire strikes back,811,LANDO,Punch it!
the empire strikes back,812,LANDO,They told me they fixed it. I trusted them to fix it. It's not  my fault!
the empire strikes back,813,PIETT,"They'll be in range of our tractor beam in moments, lord."
the empire strikes back,814,VADER,Did your men deactivate the hyperdrive on the Millennium  Falcon?
the empire strikes back,815,PIETT,"Yes, my lord."
the empire strikes back,816,VADER,Good. Prepare the boarding party and set for your weapons for  stun.
the empire strikes back,817,PIETT,"Yes, my lord."
the empire strikes back,818,THREEPIO,Noisy brute. Why don't we just go into light-speed?
the empire strikes back,819,THREEPIO,We can't? How would you know the hyperdrive is deactivated?
the empire strikes back,820,THREEPIO,"The city's central computer told you? Artoo-Detoo, you know  better than to trust a strange computer. Ouch! Pay attention to what you're doing!"
the empire strikes back,821,VADER,Luke.
the empire strikes back,822,LUKE,Father.
the empire strikes back,823,VADER,"Son, come with me."
the empire strikes back,824,LUKE,"Ben, why didn't you tell me?"
the empire strikes back,825,LANDO,Chewie!
the empire strikes back,826,LUKE,It's Vader.
the empire strikes back,827,VADER,Luke...it is your destiny.
the empire strikes back,828,LUKE,"Ben, why didn't you tell me?"
the empire strikes back,829,PIETT,Alert all commands. Ready for the tractor beam.
the empire strikes back,830,THREEPIO,"Artoo, come back at once! You haven't finished with me yet!  You don't know how to fix the hyperdrive. Chewbacca can do it. I'm standing here in pieces, and you're having delusions of grandeur!"
the empire strikes back,831,THREEPIO,"Oh, you did it!"
the empire strikes back,832,LANDO,"Luke, we're ready for takeoff."
the empire strikes back,833,LUKE,"Good luck, Lando"
the empire strikes back,834,LANDO,"When we find Jabba the Hut and that bounty  hunter, we'll contact you."
the empire strikes back,835,LUKE,I'll meet you at the rendezvous point on  Tatooine.
the empire strikes back,836,LANDO,"Princess, we'll find Han. I promise."
the empire strikes back,837,LUKE,"Chewie, I'll be waiting for your signal."
the empire strikes back,838,LUKE,"Take care, you two. May the Force be with you."
the empire strikes back,839,LUKE,Ow!
return of the jedi,1,SHUTTLE CAPTAIN,"Command station, this is ST 321. Code Clearance Blue. We're starting our approach. Deactivate the security shield."
return of the jedi,2,DEATH STAR CONTROLLER,The security deflector shield will be deactivated when we have confirmation of your code transmission. Stand by... You are clear to proceed.
return of the jedi,3,SHUTTLE CAPTAIN,We're starting our approach.
return of the jedi,4,OFFICER,Inform the commander that Lord Vader's shuttle has arrived.
return of the jedi,5,OPERATOR,"Yes, sir."
return of the jedi,6,JERJERROD,"Lord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure.  We're honored by your presence."
return of the jedi,7,VADER,"You may dispense with the pleasantries, Commander. I'm here to put you back on schedule."
return of the jedi,8,JERJERROD,"I assure you, Lord Vader, my men are working as fast as they can."
return of the jedi,9,VADER,Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.
return of the jedi,10,JERJERROD,"I tell you, this station will be operational as planned."
return of the jedi,11,VADER,The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.
return of the jedi,12,JERJERROD,But he asks the impossible. I need more men.
return of the jedi,13,VADER,Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives.
return of the jedi,14,JERJERROD,The Emperor's coming here?
return of the jedi,15,VADER,"That is correct, Commander. And he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress."
return of the jedi,16,JERJERROD,We shall double our efforts.
return of the jedi,17,VADER,"I hope so, Commander, for your sake. The Emperor is not as forgiving as I am."
return of the jedi,18,THREEPIO,"Of course I'm worried. And you should be, too. Lando Calrissian and poor Chewbacca never returned from this awful place."
return of the jedi,19,THREEPIO,"Don't be so sure. If I told you half the things I've heard about this Jabba the Hutt, You'd probably short-circuit."
return of the jedi,20,THREEPIO,"Artoo, are you sure this is the right place? I better knock, I suppose."
return of the jedi,21,THREEPIO,There doesn't seem to be anyone there. Let's go back and tell Master Luke.
return of the jedi,22,STRANGE VOICE,Tee chuta hhat yudd!
return of the jedi,23,THREEPIO,Goodness gracious me!
return of the jedi,24,THREEPIO,Artoo Detoowha bo Seethreepiowha ey toota odd mischka Jabba du Hutt.
return of the jedi,25,THREEPIO,"I don't think they're going to let us in, Artoo. We'd better go."
return of the jedi,26,THREEPIO,"Artoo, wait. Oh, dear! Artoo. Artoo, I really don't think we should rush into all this."
return of the jedi,27,THREEPIO,"Oh, Artoo!  Artoo, wait for me!"
return of the jedi,28,THREEPIO,"Just you deliver Master Luke's message and get us out of here. Oh my! Oh! Oh, no."
return of the jedi,29,BIB,Die Wanna Wanga!
return of the jedi,30,THREEPIO,"Oh, my! Die Wanna Wauaga. We -- we bring a message to your master, Jabba the Hutt."
return of the jedi,31,THREEPIO,"... and a gift.  Gift, what gift?"
return of the jedi,32,BIB,Nee Jabba no badda. Me chaade su goodie.
return of the jedi,33,THREEPIO,He says that our instructions are to give it only to Jabba himself.
return of the jedi,34,THREEPIO,I'm terribly sorry. I'm afraid he's ever so stubborn about these sort of things.
return of the jedi,35,BIB,Nudd Chaa.
return of the jedi,36,THREEPIO,"Artoo, I have a bad feeling about this."
return of the jedi,37,THREEPIO,Good morning.
return of the jedi,38,JABBA,Bo Shuda!
return of the jedi,39,THREEPIO,"The message, Artoo, the message."
return of the jedi,40,LUKE,"Greetings, Exalted One. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight and friend to Captain Solo. I know that you are powerful, mighty Jabba, and that your anger with Solo must be equally powerful. I seek an audience with Your Greatness to bargain for Solo's life.  With your wisdom, I'm sure that we can work out an arrangement which will be mutually beneficial and enable us to avoid any unpleasant confrontation. As a token of my goodwill, I present to you a gift: these two droids."
return of the jedi,41,THREEPIO,What did he say?
return of the jedi,42,LUKE,... Both are hardworking and will serve you well.
return of the jedi,43,THREEPIO,"This can't be! Artoo, you're playing the wrong message."
return of the jedi,44,JABBA,There will be no bargain.
return of the jedi,45,THREEPIO,We're doomed.
return of the jedi,46,JABBA,I will not give up my favorite decoration. I like Captain Solo where he is.
return of the jedi,47,THREEPIO,"Artoo, look! Captain Solo. And he's still frozen in carbonite."
return of the jedi,48,THREEPIO,What could possibly have come over Master Luke. Is it something I did? He never expressed any unhappiness with my work. Oh! Oh! Hold it! Ohh!
return of the jedi,49,NINEDENINE,"Ah, good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol droid, are you not?"
return of the jedi,50,THREEPIO,"I am See-Threepio, human-cy..."
return of the jedi,51,NINEDENINE,Yes or no will do.
return of the jedi,52,THREEPIO,"Oh. Well, yes."
return of the jedi,53,NINEDENINE,How many languages do you speak?
return of the jedi,54,THREEPIO,"I am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can readily..."
return of the jedi,55,NINEDENINE,Splendid! We have been without an interpreter since our master got angry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him.
return of the jedi,56,THREEPIO,Disintegrated?
return of the jedi,57,NINEDENINE,Guard! This protocol droid might be useful. Fit him with a restraining bolt and take him back to His Excellency's main audience chamber.
return of the jedi,58,THREEPIO,"Artoo, don't leave me! Ohhh!"
return of the jedi,59,NINEDENINE,"You're a feisty little one, but you'll soon learn some respect. I have need for you on the master's Sail Barge. And I think you'll fit in nicely."
return of the jedi,60,JABBA,Da Eitha!
return of the jedi,61,OOLA,Na Chuba negatorie Na! Na! Natoota...
return of the jedi,62,JABBA,Boscka!
return of the jedi,63,BOUSHH,I have come for the bounty on this Wookiee.
return of the jedi,64,THREEPIO,"Oh, no! Chewbacca!"
return of the jedi,65,JABBA,At last we have the mighty Chewbacca.
return of the jedi,66,THREEPIO,"Oh, uh, yes, uh, I am here, Your Worshipfulness. Uh... yes!"
return of the jedi,67,THREEPIO,Oh. The illustrious Jabba bids you welcome and will gladly pay you the reward of twenty- five thousand.
return of the jedi,68,BOUSHH,I want fifty thousand. No less.
return of the jedi,69,THREEPIO,"Uh, oh... but what, what did I say?  Uh, the mighty Jabba asks why he must pay fifty thousand."
return of the jedi,70,THREEPIO,Because he's holding a thermal detonator.
return of the jedi,71,JABBA,This bounty hunter is my kind of scum. Fearless and inventive.
return of the jedi,72,THREEPIO,Jabba offers the sum of thirty-five. And I suggest you take it.
return of the jedi,73,BOUSHH,Zeebuss.
return of the jedi,74,THREEPIO,He agrees!
return of the jedi,75,BOUSHH,Just relax for a moment. You're free of the carbonite.
return of the jedi,76,BOUSHH,Shhh. You have hibernation sickness.
return of the jedi,77,HAN,I can't see.
return of the jedi,78,BOUSHH,You eyesight will return in time.
return of the jedi,79,HAN,Where am I?
return of the jedi,80,BOUSHH,Jabba's palace.
return of the jedi,81,HAN,Who are you?
return of the jedi,82,LEIA,Someone who loves you.
return of the jedi,83,HAN,Leia!
return of the jedi,84,LEIA,I gotta get you out of here.
return of the jedi,85,HAN,What's that? I know that laugh.
return of the jedi,86,HAN,"Hey, Jabba. Look, Jabba, I was just on my way to pay you back, but I got a little sidetracked. It's not my fault."
return of the jedi,87,JABBA,"It's too late for that, Solo. You may have been a good smuggler, but now you're Bantha fodder."
return of the jedi,88,HAN,Look...
return of the jedi,89,JABBA,Take him away!
return of the jedi,90,HAN,Jabba... I'll pay you triple! You're throwing away a fortune here. Don't be a fool!
return of the jedi,91,JABBA,Bring her to me.
return of the jedi,92,LEIA,We have powerful friends. You're gonna regret this...
return of the jedi,93,JABBA,I'm sure.
return of the jedi,94,LEIA,Ugh!
return of the jedi,95,THREEPIO,"Ohhh, I can't bear to watch."
return of the jedi,96,HAN,"Chewie? Chewie, is that you?"
return of the jedi,97,HAN,Ah! Chew--Chewie!
return of the jedi,98,HAN,"Wait. I can't see, pal. What's goin' on?"
return of the jedi,99,HAN,"Luke? Luke's crazy. He can't even take care of himself, much less rescue anybody."
return of the jedi,100,HAN,"A...Jedi Knight? I--I'm out of it for a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur."
return of the jedi,101,HAN,"I'm all right, pal. I'm all right."
return of the jedi,102,LUKE,I must speak with Jabba.
return of the jedi,103,LUKE,You will take me to Jabba now!
return of the jedi,104,LUKE,You serve your master well.
return of the jedi,105,LUKE,And you will be rewarded.
return of the jedi,106,THREEPIO,At last! Master Luke's come to rescue me.
return of the jedi,107,BIB,Master.
return of the jedi,108,BIB,"...Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight."
return of the jedi,109,JABBA,I told you not to admit him.
return of the jedi,110,LUKE,I must be allowed to speak.
return of the jedi,111,BIB,He must be allowed to speak.
return of the jedi,112,JABBA,You weak-minded fool! He's using an old Jedi mind trick.
return of the jedi,113,LUKE,You will bring Captain Solo and the Wookiee to me.
return of the jedi,114,JABBA,"Your mind powers will not work on me, boy."
return of the jedi,115,LUKE,"Nevertheless, I'm taking Captain Solo and his friends. You can either profit by this... or be destroyed! It's your choice. But I warn you not to underestimate my powers."
return of the jedi,116,THREEPIO,"Master Luke, you're standing on..."
return of the jedi,117,JABBA,"There will be no bargain, young Jedi. I shall enjoy watching you die."
return of the jedi,118,JABBA,Bascka!
return of the jedi,119,THREEPIO,"Oh, no! The Rancor!"
return of the jedi,120,JABBA,Bring me Solo and the Wookiee. They will all suffer for this outrage.
return of the jedi,121,LUKE,Han!
return of the jedi,122,HAN,Luke!
return of the jedi,123,LUKE,Are you all right?
return of the jedi,124,HAN,"Fine. Together again, huh?"
return of the jedi,125,LUKE,Wouldn't miss it.
return of the jedi,126,HAN,How are we doing?
return of the jedi,127,LUKE,The same as always.
return of the jedi,128,HAN,"That bad, huh? Where's Leia?"
return of the jedi,129,LEIA,I'm here.
return of the jedi,130,THREEPIO,"Oh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great Jabba the Hutt, has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately."
return of the jedi,131,HAN,"Good, I hate long waits."
return of the jedi,132,THREEPIO,"You will therefore be taken to the Dune Sea and cast into the pit of Carkoon, the nesting place of the all-powerful Sarlacc."
return of the jedi,133,HAN,Doesn't sound so bad.
return of the jedi,134,THREEPIO,"In his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering, as you are slowly digested over a thousand years."
return of the jedi,135,HAN,"On second thought, let's pass on that, huh?"
return of the jedi,136,LUKE,"You should have bargained, Jabba. That's the last mistake you'll ever make."
return of the jedi,137,HAN,"I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I see a big light blur."
return of the jedi,138,LUKE,"There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know."
return of the jedi,139,HAN,"You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient."
return of the jedi,140,LUKE,Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything.
return of the jedi,141,HAN,Oh... great!
return of the jedi,142,JABBA,Soon you will learn to appreciate me.
return of the jedi,143,THREEPIO,"Oh, I'm terribly sor... Artoo! What are you doing here?"
return of the jedi,144,THREEPIO,"Well, I can see you're serving drinks, but this place is dangerous. They're going to execute Master Luke and, if we're not careful, us too!"
return of the jedi,145,THREEPIO,Hmm.  I wish I had your confidence.
return of the jedi,146,THREEPIO,"Victims of the almighty Sarlacc: His Excellency hopes that you will die honorably. But should any of you wish to beg for mercy, the great Jabba the Hutt will now listen to your pleas."
return of the jedi,147,HAN,"Threepio, you tell that slimy piece of... worm-ridden filth he'll get no such pleasure from us. Right?"
return of the jedi,148,LUKE,Jabba! This is your last chance. Free us or die.
return of the jedi,149,JABBA,Move him into position.
return of the jedi,150,JABBA,Put him in.
return of the jedi,151,LUKE,"Easy, Chewie."
return of the jedi,152,LANDO,Whoa! Whoa! Help!
return of the jedi,153,HAN,"Chewie, you okay? Where is he?"
return of the jedi,154,HAN,"I'm okay, pal."
return of the jedi,155,LANDO,Han! Chewie?
return of the jedi,156,HAN,Lando!
return of the jedi,157,HAN,Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Where?
return of the jedi,158,HAN,"Lando, grab it!"
return of the jedi,159,LANDO,Lower it!
return of the jedi,160,HAN,I'm trying!
return of the jedi,161,HAN,"Whoa! Whoa! Grab me, Chewie! I'm slipping."
return of the jedi,162,HAN,Grab it! L--Lando. Grab!
return of the jedi,163,HAN,Grab it! Almost... You almost got it!
return of the jedi,164,LANDO,Hold it! Whoa!
return of the jedi,165,HAN,"Gently now. All... all right. Now easy, easy. Hold me, Chewie."
return of the jedi,166,HAN,"Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando."
return of the jedi,167,LANDO,"No, wait! I thought you were blind!"
return of the jedi,168,HAN,It's all right. Trust me. Don't move.
return of the jedi,169,LANDO,All right! A little higher! Just a little higher!
return of the jedi,170,HAN,"Chewie, Pull us up! Come on! Okay... up, Chewie, up!"
return of the jedi,171,LEIA,Come on. We gotta get out of here quick.
return of the jedi,172,THREEPIO,"Not my eyes! Artoo, help! Quickly, Artoo. Oh! Ohhh! You beast!"
return of the jedi,173,LUKE,Get the gun! Point it at the deck!
return of the jedi,174,LUKE,Point it at the deck!
return of the jedi,175,THREEPIO,"Artoo, where are we going? I couldn't possibly jump."
return of the jedi,176,LUKE,Come on!
return of the jedi,177,LUKE,Let's go! And don't forget the droids.
return of the jedi,178,LANDO,We're on our way.
return of the jedi,179,HAN,I don't know. All I can see is a lot of blowing sand!
return of the jedi,180,LEIA,That's all any of us can see.
return of the jedi,181,HAN,Then I guess I'm getting better.
return of the jedi,182,HAN,"I've got to hand it to you, kid, you were pretty good out there."
return of the jedi,183,LUKE,I had a lot of help. Think nothing of it.
return of the jedi,184,HAN,"No, I'm thinking a lot about it. That carbon freeze was the closest thing to dead there is. And it wasn't just sleepin'. It was a big wide awake nothing!"
return of the jedi,185,LUKE,I'll see you back at the fleet.
return of the jedi,186,HAN,Why don't you leave that crate and come with us?
return of the jedi,187,LUKE,I have a promise I have to keep first... to an old friend.
return of the jedi,188,HAN,"Guess I owe you some thanks, too, Lando."
return of the jedi,189,LANDO,"Figured if I left you frozen like that you'd just give me bad luck the rest of my life, so I might as well get you unfrozen sooner or later."
return of the jedi,190,LEIA,"He means \""You're welcome.\"""
return of the jedi,191,LANDO,"Come on, let's get off this miserable dust ball."
return of the jedi,192,LUKE,I'll meet you back at the fleet.
return of the jedi,193,LEIA,Hurry. The Alliance should be assembled by now.
return of the jedi,194,LUKE,I will.
return of the jedi,195,HAN,"Hey, Luke, thanks. Thanks for comin' after me. Now I owe you one."
return of the jedi,196,LUKE,"That's right, Artoo. We're going to the  Dagobah system. I have a promise to keep...  to an old friend."
return of the jedi,197,EMPEROR,"Rise, my friend."
return of the jedi,198,VADER,The Death Star will be completed on schedule.
return of the jedi,199,EMPEROR,"You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker."
return of the jedi,200,VADER,"Yes, my Master."
return of the jedi,201,EMPEROR,"Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does, you must bring him before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force."
return of the jedi,202,VADER,As you wish.
return of the jedi,203,EMPEROR,Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen.
return of the jedi,204,YODA,Hmm. That face you make. Look I so old to young eyes?
return of the jedi,205,LUKE,No... of course not.
return of the jedi,206,YODA,"I do, yes, I do!  Sick have I become. Old and weak.  When nine hundred years old you reach, look as good you will not. Hmm?"
return of the jedi,207,YODA,"Soon will I rest. Yes, forever sleep. Earned it, I have."
return of the jedi,208,LUKE,"Master Yoda, you can't die."
return of the jedi,209,YODA,Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things ... the way of the Force.
return of the jedi,210,LUKE,But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training.
return of the jedi,211,YODA,No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need.
return of the jedi,212,LUKE,Then I am a Jedi?
return of the jedi,213,YODA,"Ohhh. Not yet. One thing remains: Vader. You must confront Vader. Then, only then, a Jedi will you be. And confront him you will."
return of the jedi,214,LUKE,Master Yoda... is Darth Vader my father?
return of the jedi,215,YODA,Mmm... rest I need. Yes... rest.
return of the jedi,216,LUKE,"Yoda, I must know."
return of the jedi,217,YODA,Your father he is.
return of the jedi,218,YODA,"Told you, did he?"
return of the jedi,219,LUKE,Yes.
return of the jedi,220,YODA,"Unexpected this is, and unfortunate.."
return of the jedi,221,LUKE,Unfortunate that I know the truth?
return of the jedi,222,YODA,No. Unfortunate that you rushed to face him... that incomplete was your training. Not ready for the burden were you.
return of the jedi,223,LUKE,"Well, I'm sorry."
return of the jedi,224,YODA,"Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force.  But beware.  Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side are they.  Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny."
return of the jedi,225,YODA,"Luke...Luke...Do not...Do not underestimate the powers of the Emperor, or suffer your father's fate, you will. Luke, when gone am I , the last of the Jedi will you be. Luke, the Force runs strong in your family. Pass on what you have learned, Luke...  There is... another...Sky...Sky...walker."
return of the jedi,226,LUKE,"I can't do it, Artoo. I can't go on alone."
return of the jedi,227,BEN,Yoda will always be with you.
return of the jedi,228,LUKE,Obi-Wan! Why didn't you tell me?
return of the jedi,229,LUKE,You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father.
return of the jedi,230,BEN,"You father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good man who was your father was destroyed. So what I have told you was true... from a certain point of view."
return of the jedi,231,LUKE,A certain point of view!
return of the jedi,232,BEN,"Luke, you're going to find that many of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our own point of view."
return of the jedi,233,BEN,"I don't blame you for being angry. If I was wrong in what I did, it certainly wouldn't have been for the first time. You see, what happened to your father was my fault."
return of the jedi,234,BEN,Anakin was a good friend.
return of the jedi,235,BEN,"When I first knew him, your father was already a great pilot. But I was amazed how strongly the Force was with him.  I took it upon myself to train him as a Jedi.  I thought that I could instruct him just as well as Yoda.  I was wrong.  My pride has had terrible consequences for the galaxy."
return of the jedi,236,LUKE,There's still good in him.
return of the jedi,237,BEN,I also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn't be done. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.
return of the jedi,238,LUKE,"I can't do it, Ben."
return of the jedi,239,BEN,You cannot escape your destiny.
return of the jedi,240,LUKE,I tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it.
return of the jedi,241,BEN,"Vader humbled you when first you met him, Luke...but that experience was part of your training. It taught you, among other things, the value of patience.  Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then, you could have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been prepared."
return of the jedi,242,LUKE,But I had to help my friends.
return of the jedi,243,BEN,"And did you help them? It was they who had to save you. You achieved little by rushing back prematurely, I fear."
return of the jedi,244,LUKE,I found out Darth Vader was my father.
return of the jedi,245,BEN,"To be a Jedi, Luke, you must confront and then go beyond the dark side - the side your father couldn't get past. Impatience is the easiest door - for you, like your father. Only, your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door, and you have held firm. You're no longer so reckless now, Luke. You are strong and patient. And now, you must face Darth Vader again!"
return of the jedi,246,LUKE,I can't kill my own father.
return of the jedi,247,BEN,Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope.
return of the jedi,248,LUKE,Yoda spoke of another.
return of the jedi,249,BEN,The other he spoke of is your twin sister.
return of the jedi,250,LUKE,But I have no sister.
return of the jedi,251,BEN,"Hmm. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous."
return of the jedi,252,LUKE,Leia! Leia's my sister.
return of the jedi,253,BEN,"Your insight serves you well. Bury your feelings deep down, Luke. They do you credit. But they could be made to serve the Emperor."
return of the jedi,254,BEN,"When your father left, he didn't know your mother was pregnant. Your mother and I knew he would find out eventually, but we wanted to keep you both as safe as possible, for as long as possible.  So I took you to live with my brother Owen on Tatooine... and your mother took Leia to live as the daughter of Senator Organa, on Alderaan."
return of the jedi,255,BEN,"The Organa household was high-born and politically quite powerful in that system. Leia became a princess by virtue of lineage... no one knew she'd been adopted, of course. But it was a title without real power, since Alderaan had long been a democracy.  Even so, the family continued to be politically powerful, and Leia, following in her foster father's path, became a senator as well.  That's not all she became, of course... she became the leader of her cell in the Alliance against the corrupt Empire. And because she had diplomatic immunity, she was a vital link for getting information to the Rebel cause.  That's what she was doing when her path crossed yours... for her foster parents had always told her to contact me on Tatooine, if her troubles became desperate."
return of the jedi,256,LUKE,"But you can't let her get involved now, Ben. Vader will destroy her."
return of the jedi,257,BEN,"She hasn't been trained in the ways of the Jedi the way you have, Luke ... but the Force is strong with her, as it is with all of your family. There is no avoiding the battle. You must face and destroy Vader!"
return of the jedi,258,HAN,"Well, look at you, a general, huh?"
return of the jedi,259,LANDO,"Oh, well, someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of Taanab."
return of the jedi,260,HAN,"Well, don't look at me, pal. I just said you were a fair pilot. I didn't know they were lookin' for somebody to lead this crazy attack."
return of the jedi,261,LANDO,I'm surprised they didn't ask you to do it.
return of the jedi,262,HAN,"Well, who says they didn't.  But I ain't crazy. You're the respectable one, remember?"
return of the jedi,263,MON MOTHMA,The Emperor has made a critical error and the time for our attack has come.
return of the jedi,264,MON MOTHMA,"The data brought to us by the Bothan spies pinpoints the exact location of the Emperor's new battle station. We also know that the weapon systems of this Death Star are not yet operational. With the Imperial Fleet spread throughout the galaxy in a vain effort to engage us, it is relatively unprotected. But most important of all, we've learned that the Emperor himself is personally overseeing the final stages of the construction of this Death Star."
return of the jedi,265,MON MOTHMA,"Many Bothans died to bring us this information. Admiral Ackbar, please."
return of the jedi,266,ACKBAR,"You can see here the Death Star orbiting the forest Moon of Endor. Although the weapon systems on this Death Star are not yet operational, the Death Star does have a strong defense mechanism. It is protected by an energy shield, which is generated from the nearby forest Moon of Endor. The shield must be deactivated if any attack is to be attempted. Once the shield is down, our cruisers will create a perimeter, while the fighters fly into the superstructure and attempt to knock out the main reactor."
return of the jedi,267,ACKBAR,General Calrissian has volunteered to lead the fighter attack
return of the jedi,268,HAN,Good luck.
return of the jedi,269,HAN,You're gonna need it.
return of the jedi,270,ACKBAR,General Madine.
return of the jedi,271,GENERAL MADINE,"We have stolen a small Imperial shuttle. Disguised as a cargo ship, and using a secret Imperial code, a strike team will land on the moon and deactivate the shield generator."
return of the jedi,272,THREEPIO,Sounds dangerous.
return of the jedi,273,LEIA,I wonder who they found to pull that off.
return of the jedi,274,GENERAL MADINE,"General Solo, is your strike team assembled?"
return of the jedi,275,HAN,"Uh, my team's ready. I don't have a command crew for the shuttle."
return of the jedi,276,HAN,"Well, it's gonna be rough, pal. I didn't want to speak for you."
return of the jedi,277,HAN,That's one.
return of the jedi,278,LEIA,"Uh, General... count me in."
return of the jedi,279,VOICE,"I'm with you, too!"
return of the jedi,280,LEIA,What is it?
return of the jedi,281,LUKE,Ask me again sometime.
return of the jedi,282,HAN,Luke.
return of the jedi,283,LUKE,"Hi, Han... Chewie."
return of the jedi,284,THREEPIO,"\""Exciting\"" is hardly the word I would use."
return of the jedi,285,HAN,Look. I want you to take her. I mean it. Take her. You need all the help you can get. She's the fastest ship in the fleet.
return of the jedi,286,LANDO,"All right, old buddy. You know, I know what she means to you. I'll take good care of her. She-she won't get a scratch. All right?"
return of the jedi,287,HAN,Right. I got your promise now. Not a scratch.
return of the jedi,288,LANDO,"Look, would you get going, you pirate."
return of the jedi,289,LANDO,Good luck.
return of the jedi,290,HAN,"You, too."
return of the jedi,291,HAN,You got her warmed?
return of the jedi,292,LUKE,"Yeah, she's comin' up."
return of the jedi,293,HAN,"No. I don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie."
return of the jedi,294,LEIA,"Hey, are you awake?"
return of the jedi,295,HAN,"Yeah, I just got a funny feeling. Like I'm not gonna see her again."
return of the jedi,296,LEIA,"Come on, General, let's move."
return of the jedi,297,HAN,"Right. Chewie, let's see what this piece of junk can do. Ready, everybody?"
return of the jedi,298,LUKE,All set.
return of the jedi,299,THREEPIO,Here we go again.
return of the jedi,300,HAN,"All right, hang on."
return of the jedi,301,VADER,"What is thy bidding, my Master?"
return of the jedi,302,EMPEROR,Send the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until called for.
return of the jedi,303,VADER,What of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust?
return of the jedi,304,EMPEROR,"It is of no concern. Soon the Rebellion will be crushed and young Skywalker will be one of us! Your work here is finished, my friend. Go out to the command ship and await my orders."
return of the jedi,305,VADER,"Yes, my Master."
return of the jedi,306,HAN,"If they don't go for this, we're gonna have to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie."
return of the jedi,307,CONTROLLER,We have you on our screen now. Please identify.
return of the jedi,308,HAN,Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the deflector shield.
return of the jedi,309,CONTROLLER,"Shuttle Tydirium, transmit the clearance code for shield passage."
return of the jedi,310,HAN,Transmission commencing.
return of the jedi,311,LEIA,Now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid.
return of the jedi,312,HAN,It'll work. It'll work.
return of the jedi,313,LUKE,Vader's on that ship.
return of the jedi,314,HAN,"Now don't get jittery, Luke. There are a lot of command ships. Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like you're trying to keep your distance."
return of the jedi,315,HAN,I don't know.  Fly casual.
return of the jedi,316,LUKE,I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come.
return of the jedi,317,HAN,"It's your imagination, kid. Come on. Let's keep a little optimism here."
return of the jedi,318,VADER,Where is that shuttle going?
return of the jedi,319,PIETT,"Shuttle Tydirium, what is your cargo and destination?"
return of the jedi,320,PILOT VOICE,Parts and technical crew for the forest moon.
return of the jedi,321,VADER,Do they have a code clearance?
return of the jedi,322,PIETT,"It's an older code, sir, but it checks out. I was about to clear them."
return of the jedi,323,PIETT,Shall I hold them?
return of the jedi,324,VADER,No. Leave them to me. I will deal with them myself.
return of the jedi,325,PIETT,"As you wish, my lord.  Carry on."
return of the jedi,326,HAN,"They're not goin' for it, Chewie."
return of the jedi,327,CONTROLLER,"Shuttle Tydirium, deactivation of the shield will commence immediately. Follow your present course."
return of the jedi,328,HAN,Okay! I told you it was gonna work. No problem.
return of the jedi,329,THREEPIO,"Oh, I told you it was dangerous here."
return of the jedi,330,LEIA,Shall we try and go around?
return of the jedi,331,HAN,It'll take time. This whole party'll be for nothing if they see us.
return of the jedi,332,HAN,Chewie and I will take care of this. You stay here.
return of the jedi,333,LUKE,"Quietly, there might be more of them out there."
return of the jedi,334,HAN,Hey... it's me.
return of the jedi,335,SCOUT #1,Go for help! Go!
return of the jedi,336,LUKE,Great. Come on.
return of the jedi,337,LEIA,Over there! Two more of them!
return of the jedi,338,LUKE,"I see them. Wait, Leia!"
return of the jedi,339,LUKE,Quick! Jam their comlink. Center switch!
return of the jedi,340,HAN,"Hey, wait! Ahhh!"
return of the jedi,341,LUKE,Move closer!
return of the jedi,342,LUKE,Get alongside that one!
return of the jedi,343,LUKE,Get him!
return of the jedi,344,LUKE,Keep on that one! I'll take these two!
return of the jedi,345,THREEPIO,"Oh, General Solo, somebody's coming. Oh!"
return of the jedi,346,HAN,Luke! Where's Leia?
return of the jedi,347,LUKE,What? She didn't come back?
return of the jedi,348,HAN,I thought she was with you.
return of the jedi,349,LUKE,We got separated.
return of the jedi,350,LUKE,"Hey, we better go look for her."
return of the jedi,351,HAN,Take the squad ahead.  We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300.
return of the jedi,352,LUKE,"Come on, Artoo.  We'll need your scanners."
return of the jedi,353,THREEPIO,"Don't worry, Master Luke.  We know what to do."
return of the jedi,354,THREEPIO,And you said it was pretty here. Ugh!
return of the jedi,355,LEIA,Cut it out!
return of the jedi,356,LEIA,I'm not gonna hurt you.
return of the jedi,357,LEIA,"Well, looks like I'm stuck here. Trouble is, I don't know where here is."
return of the jedi,358,LEIA,"Well, maybe you can help me. Come on, sit down."
return of the jedi,359,LEIA,I promise I won't hurt you. Now come here.
return of the jedi,360,LEIA,All right. You want something to eat?
return of the jedi,361,LEIA,That's right. Come on. Hmmm?
return of the jedi,362,LEIA,"Look, it's a hat. It's not gonna hurt you. Look. You're a jittery little thing, aren't you?"
return of the jedi,363,LEIA,What is it?
return of the jedi,364,SCOUT #l,"Freeze!  Come on, get up!"
return of the jedi,365,SCOUT #1,Go get your ride and take her back to base.
return of the jedi,366,SCOUT #2,"Yes, sir."
return of the jedi,367,LEIA,"Come on, let's get outta here."
return of the jedi,368,GUARD,Halt! The Emperor does not wish to be disturbed at the moment.
return of the jedi,369,VADER,"The Emperor will see me, now!"
return of the jedi,370,GUARD,"The Emperor will see you, now."
return of the jedi,371,EMPEROR,I told you to remain on the command ship.
return of the jedi,372,VADER,A small Rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on Endor.
return of the jedi,373,EMPEROR,"Yes, I know."
return of the jedi,374,VADER,My son is with them.
return of the jedi,375,EMPEROR,Are you sure?
return of the jedi,376,VADER,"I have felt him, my Master."
return of the jedi,377,EMPEROR,"Strange, that I have not. I wonder if your feelings on this matter are clear, Lord Vader."
return of the jedi,378,VADER,"They are clear, my Master."
return of the jedi,379,EMPEROR,Then you must go to the Sanctuary Moon and wait for them.
return of the jedi,380,VADER,He will come to me?
return of the jedi,381,EMPEROR,I have foreseen it. His compassion for you will be his undoing. He will come to you and then you will bring him before me.
return of the jedi,382,VADER,As you wish.
return of the jedi,383,HAN,Luke! Luke!
return of the jedi,384,THREEPIO,"Oh, Master Luke."
return of the jedi,385,LUKE,There's two more wrecked speeders back there. And I found this.
return of the jedi,386,THREEPIO,I'm afraid that Artoo's sensors can find no trace of Princess Leia.
return of the jedi,387,HAN,I hope she's alright.
return of the jedi,388,HAN,"What, Chewie? What? Chewie!"
return of the jedi,389,HAN,"Hey, I don't get it."
return of the jedi,390,HAN,"Nah, it's just a dead animal, Chewie."
return of the jedi,391,LUKE,"Chewie, wa-wait!  Don't!"
return of the jedi,392,HAN,"Nice work. Great, Chewie! Great! Always thinking with your stomach."
return of the jedi,393,LUKE,"Will you take it easy? Let's just figure out a way to get out of this thing.  Han, can you reach my lightsaber?"
return of the jedi,394,HAN,"Yeah, sure."
return of the jedi,395,THREEPIO,"Artoo, I'm not sure that's such a good idea. It's a very long dro-o-op!!"
return of the jedi,396,HAN,Wha--?  Hey!  Point that thing someplace else.
return of the jedi,397,HAN,Hey!
return of the jedi,398,LUKE,"Han, don't. It'll be all right."
return of the jedi,399,LUKE,"Chewie, give 'em your crossbow."
return of the jedi,400,THREEPIO,"Oh, my head. Oh, my goodness!"
return of the jedi,401,LUKE,Do you understand anything they're saying?
return of the jedi,402,THREEPIO,"Oh, yes, Master Luke!  Remember that I am fluent in over six million forms of communication."
return of the jedi,403,HAN,What are you telling them?
return of the jedi,404,THREEPIO,"Hello, I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive dialect.  But I do believe they think I am some sort of god."
return of the jedi,405,HAN,"Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this?"
return of the jedi,406,THREEPIO,"I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper."
return of the jedi,407,HAN,Proper?!
return of the jedi,408,THREEPIO,It's against my programming to impersonate a deity.
return of the jedi,409,HAN,"Why, you--"
return of the jedi,410,HAN,My mistake. He's an old friend of mine.
return of the jedi,411,HAN,I have a really bad feeling about this.
return of the jedi,412,HAN,What did he say?
return of the jedi,413,THREEPIO,"I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor."
return of the jedi,414,HAN and LUKE,Leia!
return of the jedi,415,LEIA,Oh!
return of the jedi,416,THREEPIO,Your Royal Highness.
return of the jedi,417,LEIA,"But these are my friends. Threepio, tell them they must be set free."
return of the jedi,418,HAN,"Somehow, I got the feeling that didn't help us very much."
return of the jedi,419,LUKE,"Threepio, tell them if they don't do as you wish, you'll become angry and use your magic."
return of the jedi,420,THREEPIO,"But Master Luke, what magic? couldn't possibly --"
return of the jedi,421,LUKE,Just tell them.
return of the jedi,422,THREEPIO,"You see, Master Luke; they didn't believe me. Just..."
return of the jedi,423,THREEPIO,"... as I said they wouldn't. Wha-wha-what's happening! Oh! Oh, dear! Oh!"
return of the jedi,424,THREEPIO,"Put me down! He-e-elp! Master Luke! Artoo! Somebody, somebody, help! Master Luke, Artoo! Artoo, quickly! Do something, somebody! Oh! Ohhh!"
return of the jedi,425,THREEPIO,"Oh, oh, oh, oh! Thank goodness."
return of the jedi,426,LUKE,"Thanks, Threepio."
return of the jedi,427,THREEPIO,I...I never knew I had it in me.
return of the jedi,428,THREEPIO,"Yes, Artoo. I was just coming to that."
return of the jedi,429,HAN,What's going on?
return of the jedi,430,LEIA,I don't know.
return of the jedi,431,THREEPIO,Wonderful! We are now a part of the tribe.
return of the jedi,432,HAN,Just what I always wanted.
return of the jedi,433,HAN,"Well, short help is better than no help at all, Chewie.  Thank you. Okay."
return of the jedi,434,THREEPIO,He says the scouts are going to show us the quickest way to the shield generator.
return of the jedi,435,HAN,"Good. How far is it? Ask him. We need some fresh supplies, too. And try and get our weapons back."
return of the jedi,436,HAN,"And hurry up, will ya? I haven't got all day."
return of the jedi,437,LUKE,"Luke, what's wrong?"
return of the jedi,438,LUKE,Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother?
return of the jedi,439,LEIA,Just a little bit. She died when I was very young.
return of the jedi,440,LUKE,What do you remember?
return of the jedi,441,LEIA,"Just...images, really. Feelings."
return of the jedi,442,LUKE,Tell me.
return of the jedi,443,LEIA,"She was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad.  Why are you asking me all this?"
return of the jedi,444,LUKE,I have no memory of my mother. I never knew her.
return of the jedi,445,LEIA,"Luke, tell me. What's troubling you?"
return of the jedi,446,LUKE,"Vader is here...now, on this moon."
return of the jedi,447,LEIA,How do you know?
return of the jedi,448,LUKE,"I felt his presence. He's come for me. He can feel when I'm near. That's why I have to go.  As long as I stay, I'm endangering the group and our mission here.  I have to face him."
return of the jedi,449,LEIA,Why?
return of the jedi,450,LUKE,He's my father.
return of the jedi,451,LEIA,Your father?
return of the jedi,452,LUKE,"There's more. It won't be easy for you to hear it, but you must. If I don't make it back, you're the only hope for the Alliance."
return of the jedi,453,LEIA,"Luke, don't talk that way. You have a power I--I don't understand and could never have."
return of the jedi,454,LUKE,"You're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has it...I have it...and...my sister has it."
return of the jedi,455,LUKE,Yes. It's you Leia.
return of the jedi,456,LEIA,I know. Somehow...I've always known.
return of the jedi,457,LUKE,Then you know why I have to face him.
return of the jedi,458,LEIA,"No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you."
return of the jedi,459,LUKE,"No, you don't. You've always been strong."
return of the jedi,460,LEIA,"But, why must you confront him?"
return of the jedi,461,LUKE,Because...there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to the Emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I have to try.
return of the jedi,462,HAN,"Hey, what's goin' on?"
return of the jedi,463,LEIA,Nothing. I - just want to be alone for a little while.
return of the jedi,464,HAN,"Nothing?  Come on, tell me.  What's goin' on?"
return of the jedi,465,LEIA,I...I can't tell you.
return of the jedi,466,HAN,Did you tell Luke? Is that who you could tell?
return of the jedi,467,LEIA,I...
return of the jedi,468,HAN,Ahhh...
return of the jedi,469,HAN,I'm sorry.
return of the jedi,470,LEIA,Hold me.
return of the jedi,471,COMMANDER,"This is a Rebel that surrendered to us. Although he denies it, I believe there may be more of them, and I request permission to conduct a further search of the area."
return of the jedi,472,COMMANDER,He was armed only with this.
return of the jedi,473,VADER,"Good work, Commander. Leave us. Conduct your search and bring his companions to me."
return of the jedi,474,COMMANDER,"Yes, my Lord."
return of the jedi,475,VADER,The Emperor has been expecting you.
return of the jedi,476,LUKE,"I know, father."
return of the jedi,477,VADER,"So, you have accepted the truth."
return of the jedi,478,LUKE,"I've accepted the truth that you were once Anakin Skywalker, my father."
return of the jedi,479,VADER,That name no longer has any meaning for me.
return of the jedi,480,LUKE,It is the name of your true self. You've only forgotten. I know there is good in you. The Emperor hasn't driven it from you fully. That is why you couldn't destroy me. That's why you won't bring me to your Emperor now.
return of the jedi,481,VADER,I see you have constructed a new lightsaber.
return of the jedi,482,VADER,"Your skills are complete. Indeed, you are powerful, as the Emperor has foreseen."
return of the jedi,483,LUKE,Come with me.
return of the jedi,484,VADER,Obi-Wan once thought as you do.
return of the jedi,485,VADER,You don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master.
return of the jedi,486,LUKE,I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me.
return of the jedi,487,VADER,If that is your destiny.
return of the jedi,488,LUKE,"Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let go of your hate."
return of the jedi,489,VADER,"It is too late for me, son. The Emperor will show you the true nature of the Force. He is your master now."
return of the jedi,490,LUKE,Then my father is truly dead.
return of the jedi,491,LEIA,The main entrance to the control bunker's on the far side of that landing platform. This isn't gonna be easy.
return of the jedi,492,HAN,"Hey, don't worry. Chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this."
return of the jedi,493,LEIA,What's he saying?
return of the jedi,494,THREEPIO,He says there's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge.
return of the jedi,495,LANDO,"Admiral, we're in position. All fighters accounted for."
return of the jedi,496,ACKBAR,Proceed with the countdown. All groups assume attack coordinates.
return of the jedi,497,LANDO,"Don't worry, my friends are down there. They'll have that shield down on time... or this'll be the shortest offensive of all time."
return of the jedi,498,ACKBAR,"All craft, prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark."
return of the jedi,499,LANDO,All right. Stand by.
return of the jedi,500,HAN,"Back door, huh? Good idea."
return of the jedi,501,HAN,It's only a few guards. This shouldn't be too much trouble.
return of the jedi,502,LEIA,"Well, it only takes one to sound the alarm."
return of the jedi,503,HAN,Then we'll do it real quiet-like.
return of the jedi,504,THREEPIO,"Oh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia!"
return of the jedi,505,LEIA,Quiet.
return of the jedi,506,THREEPIO,I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.
return of the jedi,507,LEIA,"Oh, no."
return of the jedi,508,HAN,There goes our surprise attack.
return of the jedi,509,SCOUT,Look! Over there! Stop him!
return of the jedi,510,HAN,Not bad for a little furball. There's only one left. You stay here. We'll take care of this.
return of the jedi,511,THREEPIO,I have decided that we shall stay here.
return of the jedi,512,EMPEROR,"Welcome, young Skywalker. I have been expecting you."
return of the jedi,513,EMPEROR,You no longer need those.
return of the jedi,514,EMPEROR,"Guards, leave us."
return of the jedi,515,EMPEROR,I'm looking forward to completing your training. In time you will call me Master.
return of the jedi,516,LUKE,You're gravely mistaken. You won't convert me as you did my father.
return of the jedi,517,EMPEROR,"Oh, no, my young Jedi. You will find that it is you who are mistaken...about a great many things."
return of the jedi,518,VADER,His lightsaber.
return of the jedi,519,EMPEROR,"Ah, yes, a Jedi's weapon. Much like your father's. By now you must know your father can never be turned from the dark side. So will it be with you."
return of the jedi,520,LUKE,You're wrong. Soon I'll be dead...and you with me.
return of the jedi,521,EMPEROR,Perhaps you refer to the imminent attack of your Rebel fleet.
return of the jedi,522,EMPEROR,Yes...I assure you we are quite safe from your friends here.
return of the jedi,523,LUKE,Your overconfidence is your weakness.
return of the jedi,524,EMPEROR,Your faith in your friends is yours.
return of the jedi,525,VADER,"It is pointless to resist, my son."
return of the jedi,526,EMPEROR,Everything that has transpired has done so according to my design.  Your friends up there on the Sanctuary Moon...
return of the jedi,527,EMPEROR,...are walking into a trap. As is your Rebel fleet! It was I who allowed the Alliance to know the location of the shield generator. It is quite safe from your pitiful little band. An entire legion of my best troops awaits them.
return of the jedi,528,EMPEROR,Oh...I'm afraid the deflector shield will be quite operational when your friends arrive.
return of the jedi,529,HAN,"All right! Up! Move! Come on! Quickly! Quickly, Chewie."
return of the jedi,530,LEIA,Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment.
return of the jedi,531,HAN,"Charges!  Come on, come on!"
return of the jedi,532,THREEPIO,"Oh, my! They'll be captured!"
return of the jedi,533,THREEPIO,"Wa-wait! Wait, come back! Artoo, stay with me."
return of the jedi,534,COMMANDER,Freeze! You Rebel scum.
return of the jedi,535,LANDO,All wings report in.
return of the jedi,536,WEDGE,Red Leader standing by.
return of the jedi,537,GRAY LEADER,Gray Leader standing by.
return of the jedi,538,GREEN LEADER,Green Leader standing by.
return of the jedi,539,WEDGE,Lock S-foils in attack positions.
return of the jedi,540,ACKBAR,May the Force be with us.
return of the jedi,541,LANDO,"We've got to be able to get some kind of a reading on that shield, up or down. Well, how could they be jamming us if they don't know if we're coming."
return of the jedi,542,LANDO,Break off the attack! The shield is still up.
return of the jedi,543,RED LEADER,I get no reading. Are you sure?
return of the jedi,544,LANDO,Pull up! All craft pull up!
return of the jedi,545,ACKBAR,"Take evasive action! Green Group, stick close to holding sector MV-7."
return of the jedi,546,CONTROLLER,"Admiral, we have enemy ships in sector 47."
return of the jedi,547,ACKBAR,It's a trap!
return of the jedi,548,LANDO,Fighters coming in.
return of the jedi,549,REBEL PILOT,There's too many of them!
return of the jedi,550,LANDO,Accelerate to attack speed! Draw their fire away from the cruisers.
return of the jedi,551,WEDGE,"Copy, Gold Leader."
return of the jedi,552,EMPEROR,"Come, boy. See for yourself."
return of the jedi,553,EMPEROR,"From here you will witness the final destruction of the Alliance, and the end of your insignificant Rebellion."
return of the jedi,554,EMPEROR,"You want this, don't you? The hate is swelling in you now. Take your Jedi weapon. Use it. I am unarmed. Strike me down with it. Give in to your anger. With each passing moment, you make yourself more my servant."
return of the jedi,555,LUKE,No!
return of the jedi,556,EMPEROR,"It is unavoidable. It is your destiny. You, like your father, are now mine!"
return of the jedi,557,STORMTROOPER,"All right, move it! I said move it! Go on!"
return of the jedi,558,THREEPIO,"Hello! I say, over there! Were you looking for me?"
return of the jedi,559,BUNKER COMMANDER,Bring those two down here!
return of the jedi,560,STORMTROOPER,Let's go!
return of the jedi,561,THREEPIO,"Well, they're on their way. Artoo, are you sure this was a good idea?"
return of the jedi,562,STORMTROOPER,Freeze! Don't move!
return of the jedi,563,THREEPIO,We surrender.
return of the jedi,564,THREEPIO,"Ohhh! Stand back, Artoo."
return of the jedi,565,LEIA,The code's changed. We need Artoo!
return of the jedi,566,HAN,Here's the terminal.
return of the jedi,567,LEIA,"Artoo, where are you? We need you at the bunker right away."
return of the jedi,568,THREEPIO,"Going? What do you mean, you're going. But-- but going where, Artoo? No, what! Artoo! Oh, this is no time for heroics. Come back!"
return of the jedi,569,LANDO,"Watch yourself, Wedge! Three from above!"
return of the jedi,570,WEDGE,"Red Three, Red Two, pull in!"
return of the jedi,571,RED TWO,Got it!
return of the jedi,572,RED THREE,"Three of them coming in, twenty degrees!"
return of the jedi,573,WEDGE,Cut to the left! I'll take the leader! They're heading for the medical frigate.
return of the jedi,574,NAVIGATOR,Pressure's steady.
return of the jedi,575,LANDO,Only the fighters are attacking.  I wonder what those Star Destroyers are waiting for.
return of the jedi,576,COMMANDER,"We're in attack position now, sir."
return of the jedi,577,PIETT,Hold here.
return of the jedi,578,COMMANDER,We're not going to attack?
return of the jedi,579,PIETT,I have my orders from the Emperor himself. He has something special planned for them. We only need to keep them from escaping.
return of the jedi,580,EMPEROR,"As you can see, my young apprentice, your friends have failed. Now witness the firepower of this fully armed and operational battle station.  Fire at will, Commander."
return of the jedi,581,JERJERROD,Fire!
return of the jedi,582,LANDO,"That blast came from the Death Star! That thing's operational!  Home One, this is Gold Leader."
return of the jedi,583,ACKBAR,We saw it. All craft prepare to retreat.
return of the jedi,584,LANDO,"You won't get another chance at this, Admiral."
return of the jedi,585,ACKBAR,"We have no choice, General Calrissian. Our cruisers can't repel firepower of that magnitude."
return of the jedi,586,LANDO,Han will have that shield down. We've got to give him more time.
return of the jedi,587,THREEPIO,We're coming!
return of the jedi,588,HAN,Come on! Come on!
return of the jedi,589,THREEPIO,"Oh, Artoo, hurry!"
return of the jedi,590,THREEPIO,"My goodness! Artoo, why did you have to be so brave?"
return of the jedi,591,HAN,"Well, I suppose I could hotwire this thing."
return of the jedi,592,LEIA,I'll cover you.
return of the jedi,593,LANDO,Yes! I said closer! Move as close as you can and engage those Star Destroyers at point- blank range.
return of the jedi,594,ACKBAR,"At that close range, we won't last long against those Star Destroyers."
return of the jedi,595,LANDO,We'll last longer then we will against that Death Star...and we might just take a few of them with us.
return of the jedi,596,REBEL PILOT,She's gonna blow!
return of the jedi,597,Y-WING PILOT,I'm hit!
return of the jedi,598,EMPEROR,"Your fleet has lost. And your friends on the Endor moon will not survive. There is no escape, my young apprentice. The Alliance will die...as will your friends."
return of the jedi,599,EMPEROR,"Good. I can feel your anger. I am defenseless.  Take your weapon! Strike me down with all your hatred, and your journey towards the dark side will be complete."
return of the jedi,600,WALKER PILOT #1,Look!
return of the jedi,601,PILOT #2,Get him off of there!
return of the jedi,602,HAN,I think I got it. I got it!
return of the jedi,603,THREEPIO,"Oh, Princess Leia, are you all right?"
return of the jedi,604,HAN,Let's see.
return of the jedi,605,LEIA,It's not bad.
return of the jedi,606,STORMTROOPER,Freeze!
return of the jedi,607,THREEPIO,"Oh, dear."
return of the jedi,608,STORMTROOPER,Don't move!
return of the jedi,609,HAN,I love you.
return of the jedi,610,LEIA,I know.
return of the jedi,611,STORMTROOPER,Hands up! Stand up!
return of the jedi,612,HAN,Stay back.
return of the jedi,613,HAN,"Chewie!  Get down here!  She's wounded!  No, wait....  I got an idea."
return of the jedi,614,EMPEROR,"Good.  Use your aggressive feelings, boy!  Let the hate flow through you."
return of the jedi,615,VADER,Obi-Wan has taught you well.
return of the jedi,616,LUKE,"I will not fight you, father."
return of the jedi,617,VADER,You are unwise to lower your defenses.
return of the jedi,618,LUKE,"Your thoughts betray you, father. I feel the good in you...the conflict."
return of the jedi,619,VADER,There is no conflict.
return of the jedi,620,LUKE,"You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe you'll destroy me now."
return of the jedi,621,VADER,"You underestimate the power of the dark side. If you will not fight, then you will meet your destiny."
return of the jedi,622,EMPEROR,Good.  Good.
return of the jedi,623,LANDO,Watch out. Squad at .06.
return of the jedi,624,REBEL PILOT,"I'm on it, Gold Leader."
return of the jedi,625,WEDGE,"Good shot, Red Two."
return of the jedi,626,LANDO,"Now...come on, Han, old buddy. Don't let me down."
return of the jedi,627,HAN/PILOT,"It's over, Commander. The Rebels have been routed. They're fleeing into the woods. We need reinforcements to continue the pursuit."
return of the jedi,628,CONTROL ROOM COMMANDER,Send three squads to help. Open the back door.
return of the jedi,629,SECOND COMMANDER,"Yes, sir."
return of the jedi,630,HAN,Throw me another charge.
return of the jedi,631,VADER,"You cannot hide forever, Luke."
return of the jedi,632,LUKE,I will not fight you.
return of the jedi,633,VADER,"Give yourself to the dark side. It is the only way you can save your friends. Yes, your thoughts betray you. Your feelings for them are strong. Especially for..."
return of the jedi,634,VADER,"Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed her, too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the dark side, then perhaps she will."
return of the jedi,635,LUKE,Never-r-r!
return of the jedi,636,EMPEROR,"Good! Your hate has made you powerful. Now, fulfill your destiny and take your father's place at my side!"
return of the jedi,637,LUKE,"Never! I'll never turn to the dark side. You've failed, Your Highness. I am a Jedi, like my father before me."
return of the jedi,638,EMPEROR,So be it...Jedi.
return of the jedi,639,HAN,Move! Move!
return of the jedi,640,ACKBAR,The shield is down! Commence attack on the Death Star's main reactor.
return of the jedi,641,LANDO,"We're on our way. Red Group, Gold Group, all fighters follow me.  Told you they'd do it!"
return of the jedi,642,EMPEROR,"If you will not be turned, you will be destroyed."
return of the jedi,643,EMPEROR,"Young fool...only now, at the end, do you understand."
return of the jedi,644,EMPEROR,Your feeble skills are no match for the power of the dark side. You have paid the price for your lack of vision.
return of the jedi,645,LUKE,"Father, please. Help me."
return of the jedi,646,EMPEROR,"Now, young Skywalker...you will die."
return of the jedi,647,WEDGE,I'm going in.
return of the jedi,648,LANDO,Here goes nothing.
return of the jedi,649,LANDO,Now lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power generator.
return of the jedi,650,WEDGE,Form up. And stay alert. We could run out of space real fast.
return of the jedi,651,LANDO,Split up and head back to the surface. See if you can get a few of those TIE fighters to follow you.
return of the jedi,652,PILOT,"Copy, Gold Leader."
return of the jedi,653,LANDO,That was too close.
return of the jedi,654,ACKBAR,We've got to give those fighters more time. Concentrate all fire on that Super Star Destroyer.
return of the jedi,655,CONTROLLER,"Sir, we've lost our bridge deflector shield."
return of the jedi,656,PIETT,Intensify the forward batteries. I don't want anything to get through.
return of the jedi,657,PIETT,Intensify forward firepower!
return of the jedi,658,COMMANDER,It's too late!
return of the jedi,659,VADER,"Luke, help me take this mask off."
return of the jedi,660,LURE,But you'll die.
return of the jedi,661,VADER,Nothing can stop that now. Just for once... let me look on you with my own eyes.
return of the jedi,662,ANAKIN,"Now...go, my son. Leave me."
return of the jedi,663,LUKE,No. You're coming with me. I can't leave you here. I've got to save you.
return of the jedi,664,ANAKIN,"You already have, Luke. You were right about me. Tell your sister...you were right."
return of the jedi,665,LUKE,Father... I won't leave you.
return of the jedi,666,WEDGE,There it is!
return of the jedi,667,LANDO,"All right, Wedge. Go for the power regulator on the north tower."
return of the jedi,668,WEDGE,"Copy, Gold Leader. I'm already on my way out."
return of the jedi,669,ACKBAR,Move the fleet away from the Death Star.
return of the jedi,670,LANDO,"Wedge, I don't think we're going to make it."
return of the jedi,671,WEDGE,You'll make it. Just follow me Gold Leader.
return of the jedi,672,LANDO,I promised to return his ship without a scratch...I sure hope that old pirate forgives me.
return of the jedi,673,HAN,Lando...
return of the jedi,674,THREEPIO,They did it!
